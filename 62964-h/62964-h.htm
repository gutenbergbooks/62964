<p class="ph1">The Peacock Feather</p>

<h3 class="enlarge no-break" id="PROLOGUE">PROLOGUE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was sunset.</p>

<p class="indent">The sea, which all day long had lain blue
and sparkling, was changing slowly to a warm
grey shot with moving purple and gold. The
sky flamed with crimson and amber. But gradually
the vivid warmth sank and faded; day
slowly withdrew into the soft embrace of night,
and a blue-grey mantle covered sea and sky and
land. One by one the stars shone forth till overhead
the mantle was thickly powdered with their
twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Away across the water the gleam from the
lantern of a lightship appeared at intervals, while
every now and then a stronger flash from a distant
lighthouse lit up the darkness. It flung its rays
broadcast, across the water, across the land, bringing
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>momentarily into startling prominence a great
mass of building standing on the top of the cliffs.</p>

<p class="indent">In the building a man was clinging with both
hands to a couple of iron bars that guarded the
narrow opening of his cell window. He could see
across the water and up to the star-embroidered
mantle of the sky.</p>

<p class="indent">Night after night for three years he had looked
at that moving water. He had seen it lying calm
and peaceful as it lay to-night; he had seen it
rearing angry foam-crested waves from inky
blackness. He had heard its soft, sighing music;
he had heard its sullen roar.</p>

<p class="indent">Three years! More than a thousand nights he
had looked from that narrow slit of a window,
his hands fast clutching the bars, his feet finding
slight and precarious foothold in the uneven surface
of the wall!</p>

<p class="indent">And to-night he looked for the last time. To-morrow
he would be free, free as the sea-gulls which
circled and dipped in the water along the rocky
coast or rose screaming and battling against the
tearing wind.</p>

<p class="indent">He slipped down from the window and crossed
to his pallet bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Free! Until to-night he had never dared even
to whisper that word to his inmost soul. Throughout
the long three years he had refused to let himself
think for more than the day, the moment.
He had held his mind in close confinement, a
confinement even more stringent than that to
which his body was subjected.</p>

<p class="indent">Now in that little cell he opened the windows
of his soul and let his mind go forth. Radiant,
exuberant, it escaped from its cage. It came forth
singing a Te Deum. Only a few more hours and
dawn would break. His body would know the
liberty he had already given to his mind. He was
too happy to sleep. He lay wakeful and very
still on his bed, the silence only occasionally broken
by the footfall of a warder in the passage outside.</p>

<p class="indent">The night wore on. Gradually the stars
dropped back one by one into the sky, and away
in the east a streak of saffron light appeared. It
was day at last.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">Six hours later a man was walking along a country
road. His step was light and his face held up
to meet the fresh March wind that was blowing
across the fields and hedges.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum2" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Daffodils nodded their golden heads at him from
the banks as he passed, and tiny green buds on
the brown branches were pushing forward to the
light. The whole world was vital, radiant, teeming
with growth.</p>

<p class="indent">The man held one hand in the pocket of his
grey flannel coat, his fingers pressing on two envelopes
which lay there. They had been handed to
him just before he left the great grey prison. He
had not yet opened them. For one thing, he
wanted to put a certain distance between his
present self and the past three years before he
broke the seals. For another thing, he was denying
himself, prolonging the pleasure of anticipation.</p>

<p class="indent">Now he saw a stile before him, set in the hedge
a little way back from the road, and with a patch
of grass before it. In the grass gleamed a few
pink-tipped daisies.</p>

<p class="indent">The man went across the grass and sat down
on the stile. He pulled the two letters from his
pocket and looked at them. One was addressed
in a masculine handwriting, small, square, and
very firm. The other writing was delicate but
larger. It was evidently that of a woman.</p>

<p class="indent">He opened the firmly addressed envelope first,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>and pulled out its contents. A strip of pink
paper fluttered to the ground, falling among
the daisies. He picked it up without looking at
it while he read the contents of the letter.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have no desire that you should starve,
and therefore send you the enclosed. Kindly
understand, however, that I do not wish to see you
for the present. When you have partially blotted
out the past by obtaining decent work and proving
your repentance, I will reconsider this decision.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Richard Carden.</span>&rdquo;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">The cheque was for two hundred pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">The man laughed, but the sound of his laugh
was not very pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">He broke the seal of the second letter.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I did not write before,&rdquo; the letter ran, &ldquo;because
I did not want you to brood over what I have
to say, though you must have known that my
saying it was inevitable. Of course you have
known from the first that you have by your own
conduct put an end to our engagement. I did
not write at once and tell you so myself, for fear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>of adding to your pain. But you must have understood.
You will not attempt to see me, or write
to me. It would be quite useless. I am going to
be married in three weeks&rsquo; time. I am very sorry
for you and I would have helped you if I could, but
you must see for yourself it is impossible. There is
nothing now to say but good-bye.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;M.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">When the man had finished reading he sat very
still, so still that a robin hopped down near him
and began investigating the toe of his boot. Finding
nothing in a piece of black leather of interest,
it flew up to the hedge, and regarded the motionless
figure with round beady eyes. At last the figure
moved. The robin flew a couple of yards farther
away, then perched again to watch.</p>

<p class="indent">It saw the man tearing white and pink paper
into very small pieces. Then it saw him bend
down and dig a hole in the earth with a clasp-knife.
It saw him place the pieces of torn paper
in the hole and replace the earth, which he pressed
firmly down. Then it heard the man speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;At least I will give the past decent burial.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The robin did not understand the words. What
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>has a gay little redbreast to do with either the past
or the future? The moment is quite enough.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the man stood up, and the robin saw his
face. It had grown much older in the last twenty
minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the man jauntily, though his
eyes belied the carelessness of the words, &ldquo;for the
open road.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the robin understood that speech. At
any rate it sang a sweet sturdy song of Amen.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE PIPER</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> was sitting under a hedge, playing on a
penny whistle. Behind him was a bush, snowy
with the white flowers of the hawthorn. In front
of him was a field, warm with the gold of buttercups.
Away in a distant valley were the roofs
of cottages and a farmhouse. The smoke from
one of its chimneys rose thin and blue in the
still air. It was all very peaceful, ideally
English.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter was an artist. It seemed almost incredible
that a tin instrument which could be
purchased for a penny could be made to produce
such sounds.</p>

<p class="indent">He was playing a joyous lilt. You could hear
the song of birds and feel the soft west wind blowing
from distant places; and through it was a
measured beat as of feet walking along the open
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>road. Yet under all the gaiety and light-heartedness
lay a strange minor note, a note that somehow
found reflection in Peter&rsquo;s blue eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter finished his tune and put the whistle-pipe
in his pocket. From a wallet beside him he
pulled out a hunch of bread and cheese and a very
red and shiny apple. He opened a large clasp-knife,
cut the hunch of bread in two, and fell
to eating slowly. His hands were long-fingered,
flexible, and very brown. There was a lean,
muscular look about Peter altogether. His clothes
were distinctly shabby. They consisted of a pair
of grey trousers, very frayed at the edges, and with
a patch of some darker material on one knee; a soft
white shirt, spotlessly clean; and a loose jacket,
grey flannel like the trousers. A felt hat lay on the
ground near him. In it was fantastically stuck a
peacock feather. Beside the hat was a small
bundle rolled up in a bit of sacking.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter finished the bread and cheese and the
apple, and put the clasp-knife back into his
pocket. From another pocket he pulled out a
small book, the cover rather limp and worn. He
tucked the bundle behind his back and opened the
book. Its contents did not long engross him.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>The warm May sun and the fact that he had
tramped a considerable number of miles since sunrise
had a soporific effect on Peter. His fingers
gradually relaxed their hold, the book fell to the
ground, and Peter slept.</p>

<p class="indent">His slumber was so deep that he did not hear
the footfall of a man on the soft grass, nor did he
stir when the man came near and stood looking
down upon him. He was a man of medium height
and build, with brown hair, small moustache,
and rather light eyes. There was about him an
air of finish, yet he quite escaped the epithet of
dapper.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment or so he stood looking down upon
the recumbent figure. He took in every detail,
from the frayed trousers and the spotless shirt to
the fantastic feather in the hat. He saw that
the sleeper&rsquo;s face was clean-shaven, bronzed, and
with rather high cheek-bones. The hair was
dark. There was in the sleeping face a look of
quiet weariness. To the man watching him it
was the face of one who was lonely.</p>

<p class="indent">Then his eye fell upon the book. He stooped
down and gently picked it up. The book was
open at the following lines:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

</div></div>

<p class="indent">Ten minutes later Peter stirred and yawned.
He sat up and began to stretch himself. But
in the very act thereof he stopped, and a gleam
of humorous amazement shot into his blue eyes,
for on the grass beside him a man was sitting,
calmly reading from his own rather shabby
book.</p>

<p class="indent">The man looked up.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me interrupt you,&rdquo; said Peter, with
a brilliant smile.</p>

<p class="indent">The man laughed. &ldquo;I ought to apologize,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;The fact is, when I first saw you lying
there asleep I took you for a tramp. Then I
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>came nearer and saw my mistake. I also saw the
book. The temptation to talk to a man who
obviously loved the open air and read Chaucer
was too much for me. I sat down to wait till you
should awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Very good of you,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;But you
didn&rsquo;t make a mistake, I am a tramp.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; responded the other, &ldquo;on a walking
tour.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter sat up very deliberately now. He broke
off a piece of grass, which he began to nibble.
Through the nibbling he spoke:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But I presume that your walking tour is of
fairly brief duration; mine has lasted rather
more than two years.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The other man looked at him curiously. &ldquo;You
love the open as much as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, I love the open well enough,&rdquo; replied
Peter airily; &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not the whole reason.
I can&rsquo;t afford a roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, the very obvious reply to this would have
been that Peter, a young man and, moreover,
clearly one of education, might very well work for a
roof. But it being so extremely obvious that this
was what Peter might do, it was also obvious that
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>there was some excellent reason why he did not
do it.</p>

<p class="indent">The man was silent. Peter appreciated his
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Peter deliberately, &ldquo;that
prior to my starting this &lsquo;walking tour,&rsquo; as you
so kindly term it, I had spent three years in prison
for forgery and embezzling a considerable sum of
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the man quietly, watching him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;There are always the colonies,&rdquo; went on
Peter carelessly. &ldquo;But somehow I&rsquo;ve a predilection
for England. Of course, in England there
is the disadvantage that you&rsquo;re bound to produce
references if you want work&mdash;I mean the kind
of work that would appeal to me. I dare say I
might get taken on as a day labourer on a farm,
but even there my speech is against me; it makes
people suspicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But how do you manage?&rdquo; asked the other
curiously.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter laughed. He pulled his whistle-pipe
from his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I pipe for my bread,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They call
me Peter the Piper.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The other man nodded. &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;I like that. There&rsquo;s a flavour of romance about
it that appeals to me. My name&rsquo;s Neil Macdonald.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked at him. &ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t mind
introducing yourself to a jail-bird?&rdquo; he asked
jauntily; but there was an underhint of wistfulness
in the words.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; responded Neil, &ldquo;I have
some intuition. It&rsquo;s so absolutely apparent that
you must have been shielding some one else,
that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter interrupted him. The pupils of his
blue eyes had contracted till they looked like
two pinpricks.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said slowly; &ldquo;I said
that <i>I</i> spent three years in prison for forgery
and embezzlement.&rdquo; He looked Neil full in the
face.</p>

<p class="indent">Neil held out his hand. &ldquo;I apologize,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;it was extremely clumsy of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter took his hand with a light laugh. &ldquo;It
was rather decent of you, all the same,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;though, of course, utterly absurd. You&rsquo;re the
first man, though, that&rsquo;s committed the absurdity.
You happen, too, to be the first man with whom
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>I&rsquo;ve shaken hands since I freed myself from the
clasp of a Salvation Army brother who met me
outside the prison gates and talked about my soul.
I hadn&rsquo;t the smallest interest in my soul at the
moment. I wanted a cigarette and a drink more
than anything in heaven or earth. He was a
good-meaning fellow, of course, but&mdash;well, just
a little wanting in tact. Of course, there were
others ready to hold out the hand of pity if I&rsquo;d
asked for it. But there&rsquo;d have been something
slippery about the touch. The oil of charity
doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. Somewhere in the blueness
a lark was singing, an exuberant feathered
morsel, pouring forth his very soul in song.</p>

<p class="indent">Neil broke the silence. &ldquo;Pipe to me,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter laughed. He pulled the whistle from his
pocket, and his fingers held it very lovingly. He
put it to his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">First there came a couple of clear notes, like
a bird-call; they repeated themselves in the distance
and were answered. Then the air became
alive with the joyous warbling of feathered choristers,
and through the warbling came the sound
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>of little rills chasing each other over brown stones,
where fish darted in the sunlight and dragonflies
skimmed. Next, across a meadow&mdash;one knew
it was a meadow&mdash;came the sound of little feet
and children&rsquo;s laughter. And the sound of the
laughter and the babbling of the water and the
song of the birds were all mingled in one delicious
bubbling melody drawn from the very heart of
Nature. It came to a pause. You felt the children,
the birds, and the brooks hold their breath to
listen. And then from the branches of some tree
a hidden nightingale sang alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter stopped, wiped the pipe on his sleeve, and
put it back in his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Marvellous!&rdquo; breathed Neil softly.</p>

<p class="indent">Again there was a pause, and again it was broken
by Neil.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I say, will you come back and have lunch
with me?&rdquo; There was a frank spontaneity about
the question.</p>

<p class="indent">Again the wistful look crept into Peter&rsquo;s blue
eyes. The suggestion coming suddenly was evidently
somewhat of a temptation.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;d like to,&rdquo; he said lightly, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Neil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Peter shook his head. &ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There are quite nine hundred and ninety-nine
reasons against it, and only one for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t the one reason good enough to
counteract the others?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter laughed. &ldquo;I fancy not. The high-road
has claimed me, the hedge-side is my dining-place,
the sky my roof. When it is too unkind
to me, I seek shelter in a barn. I&rsquo;ve struck up
a kind of silent intimacy with cows, sheep, and
horses. I&rsquo;ve found them, indeed, quite pleased to
welcome me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It must be horribly lonely,&rdquo; said Neil impulsively.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked away across the valley. &ldquo;I
wonder,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Perhaps it only appears so.
Formerly I walked the earth in company, and
when I got near enough to a fellow-creature to
believe that I had the right to call him comrade,
I suddenly realized that I was looking into the
face of a complete stranger. Somehow the
loneliness struck deeper home at those moments.
Now&mdash;well, one just expects nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Neil glanced down at the book he was still
holding in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Peter smiled.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Love hath my name y-strike out of his sclat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he is strike out of my bokes clene<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For ever-mo ...<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sin I am free I counte him not a bene,&rdquo;</span></div></div>

<p>he quoted. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a freedom about that,
a kind of clean-washedness which is very wholesome;
the fresh rain upon one&rsquo;s face in high places
after a room full of hot-house flowers.&rdquo; He
stopped. &ldquo;Heaven knows why I am talking to
you like this,&rdquo; he said whimsically.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy,&rdquo; said Neil calmly, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;ve
ever been really in love.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No?&rdquo; smiled Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course, you think you have,&rdquo; went on
Neil.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; smiled Peter again.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to argue with you,&rdquo; said the
other good-humouredly, &ldquo;only when the time
comes that you do love, just do me the favour to
remember what I&rsquo;ve said.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&lsquo;He is strike out of my bokes clene,&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></div></div>

<p>quoted Peter again, looking at Neil lazily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;There is,&rdquo; said Neil, &ldquo;such a thing as invisible
ink. There are certain words written with it on
the pages of our lives. The pages look uncommonly
blank, but should they chance to catch
certain heat-rays, the words written upon them
will stand out very black and clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; said Neil.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Peter. And then he got to
his feet. He picked up his wallet, bundle, and the
hat with the peacock feather. He put it jauntily
on his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I must be moving on,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Neil, too, had risen. He held out the limp book.
Peter took it and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Chaucer or you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which am I to
believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Believe which you like,&rdquo; retorted Neil. &ldquo;Time
will bring the proof. I&rsquo;m glad I met you.&rdquo; He
held out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter took it. &ldquo;Common politeness,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;should make me echo that sentiment. Truth
obliges me to hesitate. Yet frankly I like you.
Perhaps you have sufficient acumen to guess at
the reason for my hesitation. Well, good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Peter vaulted over a stile that led into the
high-road. He turned and waved his hat in the
direction of the man looking after him, then started
off at a swinging pace. Ten minutes took him
into the valley, then he began to ascend. Part
way up the hill he turned and looked at the now
distant field.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, damn!&rdquo; he said half ruefully. &ldquo;Why the
devil did I meet him!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE FIRST-BORN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon that
Peter entered a small market-town.</p>

<p class="indent">There were a good many people in the streets,
for it was market-day, and there was an air of
leisurely business about the place; completed
business chiefly, for already stalls were being
dismantled, and unsold butter, eggs, and chickens
were being repacked in big baskets. Small groups
of men stood about together discussing the weather
and the prospect of the various crops. Carts
drove slowly down the steep High Street, returning
to outlying farms.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter walked up the hill. One or two people
turned to look at him. Something about him&mdash;probably
the peacock feather in his hat&mdash;attracted
attention.</p>

<p class="indent">Half-way up the street stood a big red-brick
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>post-office. It was an imposing edifice, and
seemed to dominate the other buildings with an
air of Government importance.</p>

<p class="indent">As Peter approached it he felt his heart beating
quickly. On the steps he paused for a moment.
A girl with a small Yorkshire terrier tucked under
her arm was just coming out. She saw Peter on
the steps, and kept her hand on the swinging door
in order that he might enter. There was nothing
for it but to go forward quickly and catch the door
from her with a murmured word of thanks. Peter
was inside the post-office. He approached the
counter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Are there any letters for the name of Carden?&rdquo;
he asked. And he could hear his heart going
klip-klop.</p>

<p class="indent">The young woman behind the counter glanced
at him. Her look was rather disdainful, and
she turned in a nonchalant fashion to the pigeon-holes
behind her. She did not think it likely
there would be letters. The young man was&mdash;A,
B, C. She took a parcel and several letters
from the pigeon-hole marked C and ran carelessly
through them.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter saw her stop. She put back several
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>documents and came towards him. There was
a letter and a parcel in her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">The girl looked at him. She was a little puzzled.
Perhaps her first instinct had been at fault. In
spite of the shabby coat and hat and the extremely
fantastic feather, he did not look altogether
a tramp. She handed the things across
the counter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Peter. He tried hard to
keep a note of excited pleasure out of his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">He put the letter into his pocket, but kept the
parcel in his hand. He came out of the post-office
and turned up the hill, walking rather quickly.
He passed shops and some old-fashioned houses in
a row. At the top of the street was a big house
wall-enclosed. He left it on his right, and passed
more houses of the villa order, evidently recently
built. Presently they gave place to cottages.
Peter quickened his pace, and all the time he was
fingering that brown-paper parcel. At last the
cottages, too, were left behind, and there was
nothing but hedges and fields before him.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter turned into one of the fields and sat down
on the grass. He took out his clasp-knife and
cut the string that held the parcel, pulling forth
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>the contents. A book, green-covered, with the
title in gold lettering, was in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;<i>Under the Span of the Rainbow</i>, by Robin
Adair,&rdquo; so the lettering ran. The last was, of
course, a pseudonym.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked at it; then slowly, shyly, he opened
the cover.</p>

<p class="indent">With almost just such reverence might a mother
look on her new-born babe, marvelling at her own
creation, and quite regardless of the fact that the
same great miracle has been performed times out
of number in the world, and will be performed
again as frequently.</p>

<p class="indent">This was Peter&rsquo;s child, his first-born. Through
months of slow travail it had been created and
brought forth. Under hedges in the open air, in
barns by the light of a single candle, he had worked
while dumb beasts had looked at him with mild,
wondering eyes. In sunshine and in cloud it had
been with him; soft winds had rustled its pages,
cold blasts had crept under doors and chilled his
fingers while he wrote. And now at last, fair and
in dainty garb, it came forth to the world, breathing
the clean freshness of open spaces, of sun and
wind and rain; tender with the magic of nights,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>buoyant with the vitality of sunrise. And yet
through it all, as through his piping, lay the strange
minor note, the underhint of longing.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked up. His blue eyes were dancing
with happiness.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ouf!&rdquo; he said with a sigh of supreme content,
stretching his long lean limbs; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to have
done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Then he opened the letter. It was merely a
typewritten communication from the publishers,
informing him that they were sending him one
copy only of his book, according to his wish, and
were addressing both it and the letter to the post-office
he had mentioned. It ended by hoping that
the book would be successful, to their mutual
advantage.</p>

<p class="indent">The businesslike tone of the letter brought
Peter down to earth again. He had been temporarily
in heaven. The descent, however, was
not a jarring one.</p>

<p class="indent">He replaced the book in the brown paper, put
it carefully in his wallet, and started off across the
fields.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE DESERTED COTTAGE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some time there was nothing but open
country around him, though in the far distance
he saw an occasional farmhouse.</p>

<p class="indent">At last, however, he saw the roofs of cottages,
and realized that he was approaching a village.
The square tower of a church, and a big house half-hidden
by trees on higher ground beyond the cottages,
made it probable that it was more than
merely a hamlet.</p>

<p class="indent">Just before he reached it a sharp turn in the
lane brought him upon a very minute copse set a
pace or so back from the road, and in the copse was
a small cottage or hut. There was a forlorn
look about it, and the windows were broken.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter peered through the trees. There was no
sign of life whatever. The place was apparently
deserted. A couple of yards farther on a small and
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>broken gate led into the copse. The gate was
hanging on one hinge in a dejected and melancholy
fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter propped it up with a little pat of encouragement
before he passed through it and up among
the trees to the cottage door. It was unfastened,
and Peter went in. He found himself in a small
square room. To his amazement it was not empty,
as he had imagined to find it. On the contrary,
it was quite moderately furnished.</p>

<p class="indent">A low bed stood at one side of the room; it
was covered with a faded blue quilt. A cupboard
with a few tea-things on it stood against one wall.
A table, old and worm-eaten, was in the centre of
the room. There were two wooden chairs, and a
wooden armchair with a dilapidated rush seat.
There was a big open fireplace with an iron staple
in the wall; from this staple was suspended an
iron hook. Both were thickly covered with rust.
On the shelf above the fireplace was a clock; it
was flanked by a couple of copper candlesticks
covered with verdigris. Ragged yellow curtains
hung before the broken window.</p>

<p class="indent">And everywhere there was dust. It lay thickly
on the table and the chairs; the tea-things on the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>cupboard were covered with it. It lay upon the
floor in a soft grey carpet, thicker at the far side
of the room, where the wind through the broken
window had swept it in a little drift against the
wall.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked around in bewilderment. During
how many years had this dust accumulated?
What memories, what secrets, lay buried beneath
it?</p>

<p class="indent">He looked towards the fireplace. Charred
embers were within it. By the hearth lay an old
newspaper. Peter picked it up. It tore as he
touched it. It bore the date May the nineteenth,
eighteen hundred and sixty-six. Forty-five years
ago! Had this cottage lain uninhabited for forty-five
years?&mdash;thirteen years before he was even
born! He glanced up at the clock. It had stopped
at twelve o&rsquo;clock&mdash;midnight or noon, who was to
say?</p>

<p class="indent">Peter turned and again looked round the place.
At the foot of the bed was another door. He opened
it, and found himself in a minute room or scullery.
It contained a copper, a row of shelves, a pump,
and an iron bucket. The window here, too, was
broken, the place as thickly shrouded in dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Peter returned to the dwelling-room.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Apparently I have it all to myself,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;and for to-night at least I intend to quarter here,
for if I&rsquo;m not much mistaken there&rsquo;s a storm
coming up from the west.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter put his wallet and bundle down on the
table and went out into the copse. He began
collecting bits of dead wood from under the trees,
and there was abundance strewn on the ground,
also fir-cones, for the trees were Scotch firs. It
was already drawing on to dusk, and clouds were
being blown across the sky by a soft wet wind from
the west.</p>

<p class="indent">As Peter had just collected his second armful
of sticks, he heard steps coming along the road.
He paused before entering the cottage to see who
it might be. They were light steps, probably
those of children.</p>

<p class="indent">In a moment they came in sight&mdash;two little
girls, chattering eagerly, and walking quickly,
for the sky looked threatening. As they neared
the copse one of the children looked up. She
clutched her companion&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; she said. There was terror in
her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The other child looked, screamed, and they both
set off running frantically down the road.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Great Scot!&rdquo; ejaculated Peter; &ldquo;did they
take me for a ghost, or do they think I&rsquo;m a poacher,
and have gone to inform the neighbourhood?
Trust they won&rsquo;t disturb me; I&rsquo;ve no mind to turn
out into the deluge that&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">A couple of large drops of rain splashed down
on his hand as he spoke, and he re-entered the
cottage. He placed his second armful of sticks
beside the fireplace. First he cleared away the
charred embers in the hearth, then began arranging
the newly collected sticks with the skill born
of long practice in the art of fire-making. This
done, he went into the inner room and took up the
bucket. The pump was stiff with rust and disuse,
but Peter&rsquo;s vigorous arm soon triumphed over the
stiffness, and, filling the bucket with water, he
returned to the living-room. Here, with the aid
of a couple of ragged cloths, he made a partial
onslaught against the dust. The room became at
least habitable to one not over-fastidious. Moth,
by some miracle, seemed to have left the place
untouched, though the bedclothes were damp
with mildew.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum2" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The cleansing process at least partially achieved,
Peter undid his wallet and bundles. From them
he took a pot, a tin cup, a couple of eggs, a hunch
of bread, and small piece of butter wrapped in a
cloth.</p>

<p class="indent">He filled the pot with water, put the two eggs in
it, and hung it on the hook in the fireplace. Then
he struck a match and held it under the pile of
sticks. The little orange flame twined itself
gently round one twig. It twisted upward to
another and yet another. There was the sound of
soft crackling gradually increasing to a perfect
fairy fusillade. The flames multiplied, leapt from
stick to stick, while among their orange and blue
light poured a pearly-grey smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Achieved,&rdquo; said Peter with a sigh, and he
seated himself in the armchair watching the
dancing flames, and every now and then flinging
on an extra stick.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside the rain was beating on the roof and
splashing through the broken window, while the
wind, which had begun to rise, moaned gently
through the fir-trees, creaking their branches.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thanks be to the patron saint of all wayfarers,&rdquo;
said Peter, &ldquo;that I found this shelter.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>And if I knew his name I&rsquo;d indite a poem to his
memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And then he fell to thinking of the young man
who, earlier in the day, had intruded on his slumbers
and read poems from his Chaucer. That he
was a pleasant young man Peter had already
conceded. That he had combined an extraordinary
mixture of intuition with a certain lack of
reticence almost amounting to want of tact, Peter
also conceded. That there was nothing about
him of very deep psychological interest, Peter
knew. But&mdash;well, he was a man of gentle birth,
and he had treated Peter&mdash;the wayfaring Peter
with frayed trousers and a patch on one knee&mdash;as
an equal. It had left a very decided sensation of
pleasure. Peter acknowledged to himself that
he would have liked to accept the young man&rsquo;s
invitation; and yet if he had&mdash;well, he would
probably have drivelled more than he had done,
and he had drivelled quite enough. That was
the worst of unaccustomed and genuine interest
from one of your fellow-men. It was like
wine to one not used to it&mdash;it mounted to your
brain, you became garrulous. To those who are
used to wine, one glass, two glasses, nay, even
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>three glasses, means nothing. To those who have
not tasted the liquor for years, half a glass may
prove unsteadying. It was not even as if it
would be offered to him with sufficient frequency
for him to become accustomed to it. No; most
assuredly the wine of sympathy was not for him.</p>

<p class="indent">And then he stopped suddenly in his meditations,
for the water in the pot was boiling.</p>

<p class="indent">When Peter had finished his meal he pulled
a brier-wood pipe from his pocket, filled it with
tobacco, and lit it. He also lit a candle, which he
set in one of the copper candlesticks and placed
upon the table. Then once more he drew his book
from the brown-paper covering.</p>

<p class="indent">For a time he sat very still, only moving a hand
to turn the pages. The candle-light threw his
shadow large and grotesque on the dingy wall
behind him. Occasionally the shadow wavered
as the candle flickered in the draught from the
broken window. The fire had died down to a few
glowing spots set in a bed of grey ashes. Outside
the rain fell steadily, and the wind still creaked the
branches of the fir-trees.</p>

<p class="indent">At last Peter closed the book. He rolled his
piece of sacking into a bundle to form a pillow, and
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>stretched himself on the stone floor before the
hearth. It was preferable, he considered, to the
mildewy bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;who were the former
owners of this place. No doubt they are long
since dead. Well, if so, on their souls, and on all
Christian souls, sweet Jesu, have mercy!&rdquo; He
made the sign of the Cross.</p>

<p class="indent">In ten minutes Peter was asleep. He slept
well, but he dreamt, and once or twice through
his dreams he heard the sound of sobbing. It
was a pitiful little sobbing, as of a woman in grief,
and mingled with it seemed to be faint half-articulate
words.</p>

<p class="indent">Once Peter half-awakened, and for a moment he
fancied the sobbing was real, but reason, which
was working fitfully, told him it was only the wind
in the trees without. He shifted his position and
fell asleep again.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</p>

<h3 class="no-break">PETER TAKES A RESIDENCE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> came out from the cottage door in the
early morning. The rain of the previous night had
ceased, only the trees, bushes, and grass were hung
with myriads of drops sparkling silver and diamond
in the morning sunshine. He smelt the
good smell of the wet earth, and filled his lungs
with the cool fresh air.</p>

<p class="indent">By rights Peter should by now have been well on
his way, for, though his way led generally to no
particular goal, he was always a-foot by sunrise.
But something&mdash;Peter did not know what&mdash;held
him to that cottage. It was almost as if the desolate
place cried to him: &ldquo;Stay with me; I, too,
am lonely.&rdquo; Certainly something indefinable but
insistent was drawing him to remain.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; said Peter half aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">And then he heard the creaking of a cart, and
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>the gruff voice of a carter encouraging his horse.
In a moment it came in sight. The cart was
empty, and the man was sitting on the side as
he drove.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Peter pleasantly, as the
cart and man came abreast of him.</p>

<p class="indent">The carter started, pulled up suddenly, and
the horse came to a standstill.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; he said in amazement, &ldquo;whatever
do-ee be doin&rsquo; there?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I sheltered here last night,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Can
you tell me to whom this cottage belongs?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The man shook his head. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t belong
to no one, and that&rsquo;s certain sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; argued Peter, &ldquo;a cottage which is
obviously built by human agency must have an
owner.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Again the man shook his head. &ldquo;It don&rsquo;t
belong to no one,&rdquo; he reiterated.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter raised his eyebrows incredulously. &ldquo;But
why not?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis evil,&rdquo; said the man in a solemn whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Evil!&rdquo; echoed Peter. And the word seemed
as out of place in the morning sunshine as a cynic
would seem in fairyland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The man nodded. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis evil, for sure. &rsquo;Tis
haunted.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And by what is it haunted?&rdquo; demanded
Peter, curious.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A bad woman,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Her comes
there o&rsquo;nights, and her moans for that her soul&rsquo;s
to hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Again the word fell like a discord in the harmony
of sunshine and singing birds. Peter frowned.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;as the cottage possesses
no owner I suppose I can live here if I choose?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The man scratched his head. &ldquo;No one can&rsquo;t
live there what bain&rsquo;t in league with t&rsquo;devil,&rdquo;
he announced.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter smiled brilliantly. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said with
fine assurance, &ldquo;but I am.&rdquo; And he made the
carter a low bow, sweeping upward his hat, which
he had hitherto held in his hand. The fantastic
peacock feather came into view, also Peter concluded
the bow with a very diabolical grin.</p>

<p class="indent">The man whipped up his horse, casting a terrified
glance over his shoulder as he drove off. Peter
waved his hat with a mocking laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, as the sound of the wheels
receded in the distance, &ldquo;it is possible that my
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>averred friendship with his Satanic Majesty
may gain me uninterrupted possession of this
place. And&mdash;nonsense or not&mdash;it is asking me
to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly, however, it struck Peter that it
might be as well for him to lay in a small store
of provisions&mdash;if such were obtainable in the village&mdash;before
the statement of his friendship with the
powers of evil had been spread by the too credulous
carter. Peter was well aware of the superstitions
of village folk. Therefore he set off at once down
the road.</p>

<p class="indent">The village stood for the most part around an
open green, to the left of which was the grey church
whose square tower he had noticed the previous
day. In front of him and on higher ground, half-hidden
among the trees, was a white house. It
looked of some importance. On the right of the
green was the post-office, and next to it a general
provision shop.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter went into the post-office, where he asked
for a penny stamp.</p>

<p class="indent">The woman who kept the place was a buxom
dame, rosy-cheeked and brown-eyed. Peter
thought she might be possessed of conversational
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>powers. He was right. A small remark of his
received a voluble response. He ventured another.
It also was received in good part and the dame&rsquo;s
tongue proved nimble.</p>

<p class="indent">For full half an hour Peter leant upon the
counter, speaking but a word or two at intervals,
but finding that they quite sufficed to direct the
voluble flow of speech into the channels he desired.
The sound of the bell above the shop door alone
brought the discourse to a conclusion, as a woman,
with a baby in her arms and two children dragging
at her skirts, entered. She looked at Peter curiously,
then, pulling a shabby purse from her
pocket, requested the postmistress to provide her
with a penny stamp. She was, so she stated, about
to write to her son in South Africa.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter came out into the sunlight with vastly
more information than he had possessed half an
hour previously.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned into the provision shop, where he
achieved a few purchases, and then made his way
again in the direction of the desolate cottage. In
his mind he was running through and sorting the
information he had received.</p>

<p class="indent">First and foremost it was perfectly obvious that,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>provided he had the temerity to remain in the
cottage in which he had passed the previous night,
no one would say him nay. It was held in ill-repute.
No one would dream of entering the copse
at any time, and after nightfall even the road past
it was to be avoided. The reason for this, as far
as Peter could gather, was as follows.</p>

<p class="indent">Some fifty or sixty years ago a woman had lived
in that cottage with her daughter, the reputed
beauty of the village. The cottage had been built
on a bit of unclaimed land by the woman&rsquo;s husband,
who had died soon after building it. It
appeared that the girl was a coquette, trifling with
the solid affection of the village swains. That at
least was the version of the postmistress. One day
some young gentleman had come to stay at the inn.
What brought him if it was not Satan himself no
one knew. At all events, before long he and the
village Helen were seen walking together on summer
evenings. Then came a day when the young
man left the inn, and it was discovered that the
girl was missing. Good authority stated that she
had gone with him. It also stated that after three
months he deserted her. From then began her
downfall. The mother, left in the cottage, faded
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>slowly from grief, and after five years died. On
the evening of her death a thin wan woman great
with child was seen to enter the village. None,
it appeared, had spoken to her. She had passed
through the village and towards the cottage where
the dead woman lay. The friend who was keeping
watch saw the door open and a pale woman with
frightened eyes approach the bed. There had been
a terrifying shriek and the intruder had dropped
to the ground. During the hours of the night a
little life had come forth, which looked momentarily
and wearily on the world. With a sigh it
had gone out again into the silence, where at dawn
the weary mother had followed it. But remorse,
so it was said, had chained her to the spot where
her own mother had died, and throughout the
following nights her spirit could be heard sobbing
and moaning. For more than forty years the
place had been considered cursed, and had been
steadfastly avoided. Even the contents of the
cottage had remained untouched.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter had ventured a word of pity for the desolate
creature whose story he had just heard. But
pity was, apparently, the last emotion roused towards
her. Horror of her sin and degradation, a
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>horror enhanced by the superstition vivid around
her memory, was all the buxom postmistress felt.
And should any one be wickedly daring enough
to enter the cottage and live there&mdash;well, the curse
of evil would undoubtedly fall upon him, though
assuredly no one would interfere should any one
prove himself a sufficient friend of evil for such a
venture.</p>

<p class="indent">So much had Peter gathered regarding the
cottage and its story. He had then put another
question regarding the white house on
the hill.</p>

<p class="indent">It belonged, so he was told, to a Lady Anne
Garland, who lived there with a companion. At
the moment she was away from home, though she
was expected to return in June. And then the
other customer had entered the shop, and the
flood of the good woman&rsquo;s discourse had been
stemmed.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter had reached the copse by now and turned
in at the broken gate. As he entered the cottage
it seemed to him that there was an air of expectancy
about the place, as if it was waiting for the
answer to a question.</p>

<p class="indent">Involuntarily Peter spoke aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am going to stay
till some one comes to kick me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And then&mdash;of course it was mere fancy, but a
little breeze seemed to pass through the room,
like a sigh of relief or content.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE SOUL OF A WOMAN</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> Peter entered upon his estate, since there
was evidently no man would say him nay. He,
the wayfarer, who for two years had slept by the
hedge-side or in barns, found himself possessed
of a castle.</p>

<p class="indent">It might be conjectured whether he would find
the change cramping, stifling. He did not. The
windows, which he mended, he set wide open to the
sun and wind. Big fires of sticks and fir-cones
aired and freed the place from the odour of damp
and decay that hung about it. He took the
precaution of buying a couple of blankets and
a mattress. Also, as he was once more to become
a civilized being, at all events in his own
eyes, he bought three suits of the garments called
pyjamas.</p>

<p class="indent">They pleased Peter enormously. Blue, pink, and
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>green, he placed them on the table and looked at
them. They told him as plainly as their flannel
tongues could speak that he had returned to
his birthright. He had purchased them in the
market town already mentioned, which lay some
eight miles distant from the cottage, and the
purchase had been made with an air of swagger.
Piping had proved a not unremunerative occupation.
There was now, however, another source
of income. Certainly the income would not be
large at present, but it well sufficed. Peter would
therefore pipe no longer for pay, but merely for
pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent">He had also laid in a store of fair foolscap paper
and a large bottle of ink. The joy of creation had
taken possession of him. His brain was again
fertile. It was partly on this account that he had
been ready to take up a fixed abode, since fate had
flung one in his path. He owed it to the children
of his brain to give them every chance, though his
first child had been brought forth amidst difficulties
and hardships.</p>

<p class="indent">The news that a stranger, wearing a peacock
feather in his hat, had taken up his abode in the
cottage of ill-omen spread like wild-fire through
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>the village. Women glanced at him with frightened
eyes, men regarded him with suspicion. The
owner of the provision shop, indeed, held a kind
of neutral ground. Until it should be proved that
Peter&rsquo;s shillings were accursed, he might as well
have the advantage of them.</p>

<p class="indent">The children looked at Peter with awe, mingled
with curiosity. There was a kind of fearful joy
in watching one who was a friend of that terrible
personage the Devil. At night, truly, he was to be
avoided, but in daylight, with his bronzed face and
brilliant peacock feather, he looked not unprepossessing.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, he could pipe. Wee Rob, the miller&rsquo;s
lame son, had first heard him, and had called to
the other children. There had been a reconnoitring
party down the lane. On tiptoe feet, breath
suspended, eyes round with awe, they had gone.
Through the bushes they had seen him at the
cottage door, the pipe at his lips. And the music
had been full of they knew not what of magic,
joy and gladness. With parted lips and eyes full
of childish wonder they had listened. Fear had
vanished to the four winds of heaven, blown far
far away by the sweet notes of the pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p class="indent">And then Peter had stopped and moved.
There had been the scuttling of little feet and the
tapping of a crutch. But the tapping of the crutch
had been reluctant in its retreat, for the magic of
the piping lingered with Wee Rob.</p>

<p class="indent">By day, then, Peter wrote in his cottage, piped
his tunes, or walked the moorland above the
village. By night he slept and dreamt of the book
he was writing, though often through his dreams
he fancied he heard the sound of that pitiful
sobbing.</p>

<p class="indent">In his waking moments he told himself it was
fancy pure and simple, yet it troubled him. What
if there were indeed an imprisoned soul somewhere
seeking aid, one for whom no man had said an
individual prayer? Peter had no very definite
creed. There lingered with him certain faint
memories of lessons taught him by his mother, of
which the little prayer he had prayed the first
night in the cottage was one. Beyond that all
was indefinite, vague. Somewhere external to this
world were unseen Powers, some great Force, a
Strength to whom men appealed under the name
of God. The supernatural, however, had, or
appeared to have, no very distinct individual
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>relation towards himself. He had certainly prayed
when he was in the prison. Human aid being
powerless to &ldquo;put things right&rdquo; (he formulated
his ideas no more than that), he had appealed
to this External Power. He had found a certain
comfort in it. He acknowledged its might, its
capacity to do so. Having prayed, he felt sure of
the answer. His attitude towards the Powers was
friendly. There is no other word which will as
well describe his attitude of mind. Surely, then,
he had a right to expect a friendly reply. And
then the reply had come. For a time Peter had
been stunned. It had been so entirely unexpected.
He felt almost as a man would feel who had received
a blow from one from whom he had a right
to expect a handshake. A curious bitterness was
his first predominant sensation. This did not last,
however. Peter was too innately sweet-natured
to harbour bitterness long, even against those
vague external Powers of which he knew so little.
A nonchalant philosophy took its place. They
had failed him, therefore he must turn elsewhere
for aid; he must turn to the visible means around
him, the things of nature, the sunshine, the trees,
the flowers, the birds. In short, the recuperative
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>power of his own healthy nature sustained him,
since the Powers to whom he had turned seemed
to have failed. And yet he did not deny their
existence. Only it would appear that their attitude
towards him individually was not what he
had imagined it to be. Now, however, vaguely,
indefinitely, he began to wonder whether their
aid could not be invoked again, not for himself,
but for another, the soul of the woman whose
fancied sobbing troubled his dreams. He told
himself, as already stated, that the sobbing was
pure fancy, the outcome of the pitiful story he had
heard, his own imagination, and certain faint
memories of his mother&rsquo;s teaching regarding souls
in purgatory. Solitude no doubt coloured these
memories, rendered him possibly slightly morbid
regarding them. Yet the fancy was strong upon
him that he, in that place where the soul of
the woman had left her body, might in some
way aid. Yet how? There was the crux of the
question.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Peter bethought him of a friend of his,
one whose creed, though he himself had inquired
little regarding it, he knew to be clear-cut, defined.
Perhaps, Peter told himself, his own prayers were
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>too vague, too nebulous. For himself he was
content, or at least sufficiently passive now, to
let things remain as they were. For himself, his
prayer had failed; he would not be cowardly
enough to whine, or recriminate. It was just
possible that even the failure belonged to some
Great Plan of which he did not see the outcome.
He perceived in the same nebulous way that if
this were the case rebellion would be not only
cowardly, but futile. Yet while remaining passive
for himself, something within him stirred him
to action for another. He had heard his friend
speak of masses for souls in purgatory. It conveyed
nothing very definite to Peter&rsquo;s mind, yet
he felt that if there were some method of aiding
this soul his friend would know of it.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly Peter wrote a letter. He gave no
address; he merely wrote stating the facts of the
case, and asking aid. After that he waited.</p>

<p class="indent">Now again he was perfectly aware that the whole
thing might have been pure fancy, but one day
Peter became conscious of a change of atmosphere
in the cottage. A repose, a peace, hitherto foreign
seemed to have descended upon it. When precisely
the change occurred Peter did not know, he
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>merely suddenly became conscious that the change
was there.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course it might have been pure fancy, but
Peter did not think it was.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</p>

<h3 class="no-break">AN OLD GENERAL</h3>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span> Carden, V.C., C.B., D.S.O., was sitting
at breakfast in his house in Sloane Street.
He was not a young man&mdash;in fact, he had just
passed his seventy-seventh birthday&mdash;but there
was about him an air of trim spruceness, an uprightness
that many a younger man might have
envied. His height in his stockinged feet was
exactly six feet one. He was handsome, too, with
his fine aquiline features, his snow-white hair, and
his drooping moustache. His blue eyes, under
shaggy eyebrows, were perhaps a trifle faded from
the colour of their youth, yet they struck a very
decided note in contrast to his face, which was
like old ivory, and to the pallor of his hair.</p>

<p class="indent">A little pile of letters lay on the table beside
him, also a small silver paper-knife. Ten minutes
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>previously he had cut the envelopes with careful
precision and glanced through the contents.
Apparently he had found in them little of interest,
and now his attention was entirely absorbed by a
couple of frizzled rolls of bacon on the plate before
him.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened noiselessly and the butler
entered. He carried a tray on which was a plate,
and on the plate was a small brown egg in a silver
egg-cup. General Carden was somewhat particular
as to the size and colour of the eggs of which
he partook. The butler placed the plate on the
table, then stood in an attitude suggestive of
military attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Any orders for the car, sir? Alcott is here,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The car at eleven,&rdquo; said General Carden, still
busy with the bacon. &ldquo;And, Goring, see that
those library books are put in.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Very good, sir. Is that all, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes; nothing else.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The butler withdrew, and General Carden
continued his breakfast. Marmalade and a
second cup of coffee followed the egg. General
Carden made a good deal of the fact that he
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>enjoyed his breakfast. It was to him a sign
that old age was not yet encroaching.</p>

<p class="indent">Breakfast over, he crossed the hall to a small
study, where he took a cigarette from a silver
box and lighted it. Then he sat down in a chair
near the window with the morning paper. It
seldom afforded him much satisfaction, however.
England, in his opinion, was going to the dogs, and
it only annoyed him to see the printed record of its
progress towards that deplorable end.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few moments he threw the paper from
him with a faintly muttered &ldquo;Damn it, sir!&rdquo;
He had seen that in a by-election a seat had been
won by one of the Labour party.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Going to the dogs, sir; entirely to the dogs!&rdquo;
he muttered. And then he looked out of the
window at the people in the street, which street
was bathed in May sunshine.</p>

<p class="indent">The gardens opposite looked extraordinarily
green and spring-like, and nurses with perambulators
and children of various sizes were passing
along the pavement by the iron railings. They
and the sunshine struck a very definite note of
buoyancy and youth, and for a moment General
Carden felt not entirely as young as he could wish.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>The room seemed a little lonely, and the house
rather large for one occupant&mdash;servants, naturally,
did not count. General Carden did not exactly
express this thought to his mind in words. He was
not a man given to sentimentality either in thought
or speech. It was merely represented by a little
indefinite and not very pleasant impression. He
wheeled his chair round to his writing-desk, which
he unlocked, and began looking through various
letters with a show of businesslike energy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">Some half-hour or so later he appeared in the
hall. The butler was there already with an overcoat,
a silk hat, and an air of reserved dignity.
He put General Carden into the overcoat and
handed him the hat.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Have you put the books in the car?&rdquo; asked
General Carden.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Goring. There was the
faintest suspicion of reproof in the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah! yes, of course, of course; I mentioned it
at breakfast.&rdquo; General Carden took up his gloves
and passed into the sunshine down the steps, an
upright figure in grey overcoat, white spats, and
hat shining glossily in the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Good morning, Alcott; the car running well?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;First rate, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; that&rsquo;s right. You can take a
turn in the Park and afterwards go to Mudie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Very good, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden got in, and the car purred
gently up the street.</p>

<p class="indent">He settled himself comfortably into a corner,
and glanced at the books on the seat opposite
to him. He had a subscription at Mudie&rsquo;s, and
kept himself thoroughly up in the present-day
novel. He did not care to hear a new book
mentioned and have to allow that he had not read
it. Of course, the present-day literature could
not compare with that of the older novelists&mdash;that
was hardly to be expected. Scott, Dickens,
Thackeray&mdash;he ran through them in his mind&mdash;where
was the writer of the moment who could
compare with them? Who could touch the romance
of Scott, the humour of Dickens, the courtliness
of Thackeray? Where was there a man in
present fiction able to stand beside the fine
old figure of General Newcome? No; romance,
humour, courtliness, had vanished, and in their
place were divorce accounts, ragging&mdash;an appalling
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>word,&mdash;and suffragettes. The world was not what
it had been in his young days. He did not, however,
express this opinion blatantly; to do so
would have savoured of old-fogyism. Oh, no;
he flattered himself he kept abreast of the times,
and only deplored certain modern innovations,
as they were deplored by all those who still held
to the fragments of refinement and courtliness
that remained in the world.</p>

<p class="indent">As the car turned into the Park, General Carden
sat rather more upright. He watched the carriages
and their occupants with attention, his old
eyes keen to observe and note any of them he knew.
And when he did, off came that glossy silk hat with
a bow and a gesture worthy of a courtier. However
much abreast of the times he might choose to
consider himself, in his heart he knew he was of
the old school, and one even older than that of his
own youth. He belonged, this courtly old man,
to the delightful old school where men treated
women with chivalry and protection, and where
women in their turn accepted these things with
delicate grace and charm; where conversation
had meant a pretty display of wit, a keen fencing
of words, where brusquerie was a thing unknown;
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>and where a fine and subtle irony had stood in the
place of a certain curt rudeness noticeable in the
present day. Yet all that was of the past. It
would be as out of place now as would be one of
those dainty ladies of old years, in powder and
brocade, among the tight-skirted women in Bond
Street. But very deep down in his heart General
Carden knew it was the school which he loved,
and of which he allowed himself occasionally to
dream. Those dreams were dreamt mainly on
winter evenings in a chair before the study fire.
And then, very surreptitiously, General Carden
would bring a tiny gold box from his pocket&mdash;a
dainty octagon box with an exquisite bit of old
enamel, blue as a sapphire, let into the lid&mdash;and,
opening it, he would take an infinitesimal pinch of
brown powder between his first finger and thumb.
He was always most extremely careful that no
single grain of it should fall on his white shirt-front.
Goring&rsquo;s eyes were at times unaccountably sharp.
He was not going to be caught snuff-taking by a
man who might look upon it as a sign of old age
advancing. The little gold box, when not on his
own person, was kept locked in a small antique
cabinet in his dressing-room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Apparently there were many people in the Park
that morning whom General Carden knew. A big
car hummed past with a small woman in it, a
woman who looked almost tiny in the car&rsquo;s capacious
depths. She had a pointed little face and
masses of fair hair. Off came General Carden&rsquo;s
hat. This was Muriel Lancing. He had known
her as Muriel Grey, when she was a small girl in
short skirts. She had married a certain Tommy
Lancing a refreshing young man with red hair and
freckles and a comfortable private income. General
Carden&rsquo;s eyes smiled at the girl. In spite of
a certain airy up-to-dateness, he liked her. She
was so dainty, so piquante, and such an inscrutable
mixture of child, woman of the world, and elfin.
One never knew which of the three might not
appear on the surface. Also he liked Tommy, who
always contrived to put a certain air of deference
into his manner towards the General, which
secretly pleased that critical white-haired, old
veteran immensely.</p>

<p class="indent">After a few moments he saw another of his
friends, and again the hat came off, this time
with perhaps even something more of courtliness.
The woman in the victoria was very nearly a contemporary
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>his. Quite a contemporary, General
Carden reflected&mdash;ignoring the fifteen years which
lay between them, and which were, it must be
stated, to the advantage of Mrs. Cresswell. She
was a woman with white hair rolled high, somewhat
after the style of a Gainsborough portrait,
and a clear-cut aristocratic face. She belonged
unquestionably to his school, and their conversations
were an invariable delicate sword-play of
words. Even if she were generally the victor&mdash;and
in the art of conversation he was willing to
concede her the palm&mdash;yet he flattered himself he
was no mean opponent, and he had a pleasurable
memory of some very pretty turns of repartee on
his own part. She was a friend of long standing,
and one he valued.</p>

<p class="indent">Next came a much younger woman in a car,
with a small boy beside her. This was Millicent
Sheldon; the boy was her nephew. General
Carden&rsquo;s blue eyes were a little hard as he observed
her, and there was just a suspicion of stiffness in
his arm as he raised his hat. She responded with
a slightly frigid bow, her face entirely immovable.
There were reasons&mdash;most excellently good reasons&mdash;why
there was a certain chilliness between these
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>two. They need not, however, be recorded at
the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">Many other carriages and cars passed whose
occupants General Carden knew, also a few foot-passengers,
grey-haired veterans like himself,
who walked upright and rather stiff, or younger
men slightly insouciant of manner.</p>

<p class="indent">As his car was turning out of the Park another
carriage turned in. In it was a young woman and
an older one&mdash;much older; in fact, rather dried
up and weather-beaten. This time General Carden
did not raise his hat, though he observed the two
women with interest. He had frequently noticed
the carriage and its occupants during his morning
drives in the Park. The younger woman attracted
him. It was not merely the fact that she was
beautiful, but there was an air of distinction about
her, a well-bred distinguished air, that appealed
to this old critic of women and manners. The men
on the box wore cockades in their hats and plum-coloured
livery. There was also a tiny coronet on
the panel of the carriage door. In spite of the fact
that General Carden&rsquo;s sight was not entirely what
it once had been, he noticed the coronet. He
noticed, too, that the woman&rsquo;s hair was black with
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>blue lights in it, that her skin was a pale cream,
and her mouth a delicious and quite natural scarlet;
also that her small well-bred head was exquisitely
set on a slender but young and rounded throat,
and that it, in its turn, was set quite delightfully
between her shoulders. There is no gainsaying
the fact that General Carden was a very distinct
connoisseur in matters feminine. He wondered
who she was, and even after the carriage had
passed he thought of her very finished appearance
with pleasure. And it was by no means the first
time that he had wondered, nor the first that he
had experienced the feeling of pleasure at the sight
of her.</p>

<p class="indent">In two or three minutes, so swift are the ways
of cars, he was stopping opposite Mudie&rsquo;s in
Kensington High Street. A carriage with a pair
of bay horses was waiting beyond the broad
pavement outside the shop. General Carden
recognized it as belonging to Mrs. Cresswell.
Evidently she had left the Park before him.</p>

<p class="indent">He got out of the car and crossed the pavement
to the shop. Mrs. Cresswell was also changing
library books. She saw him approaching and
gave him a smile&mdash;a smile at once brilliant, gay,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>and charmingly intimate, as was the privilege of
an old friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;So we meet again,&rdquo; she said in her crisp,
pleasantly decided voice, and she held out her
hand. &ldquo;And how are you this fine May
morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;In most excellent health, thank you,&rdquo; replied
General Carden, taking the hand held out to him.
&ldquo;There is no need for me to ask how you are.
You look, as you always do, radiant.&rdquo; He accompanied
the words with a gesture almost suggestive
of a bow.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;How charming of you!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Cresswell,
a little laugh in her eyes. &ldquo;I always feel at least
ten years younger when I meet you. And you are
on the same errand bent as I. Well, here is one
book I can certainly recommend. I am just
returning it myself. It is by a new author, and
is quite delightful&mdash;finished, light, and with a
style all its own.&rdquo; She held up a green-covered
book as she spoke, and General Carden read
the gold-lettered title, <i>Under the Span of the
Rainbow</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, to be perfectly candid, the title did not
appeal to him who read it. In General Carden&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>mind it suggested fairy-tales&mdash;light, airy, soap-bubbly
things, iridescent and pretty enough for
the moment, but quite unable to withstand the
finger of criticism he would inevitably lay upon
them. Yet the book was recommended by a
woman, and that woman Mrs. Cresswell.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Any recommendation of yours!&rdquo; said General
Carden gallantly. And he put the book aside
while he looked for a second one.</p>

<p class="indent">A young shopman made various deferential
suggestions, and presently Mrs. Cresswell and
General Carden were out again in the sunshine,
General Carden bearing four library books.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I shall expect to hear what you think of my
recommendation,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cresswell, as he
handed her to her carriage and placed two of the
books on the seat beside her. Her voice held
perhaps the faintest intonation of significance.
&ldquo;Come and see me next Tuesday; I am at home,
you know.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;With all the pleasure in the world,&rdquo; replied
General Carden.</p>

<p class="indent">And then she gave him another of her gracious
smiles as the bays moved off down the sunny
street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">It was not till after dinner that night that General
Carden opened the book. He was then sitting
in a large and comfortable armchair in his study.
A shaded electric lamp stood on a table at his
elbow, and he was experiencing the sense of well-being
of a man who has just partaken of a most
excellently cooked dinner.</p>

<p class="indent">He fixed his gold-rimmed glasses on his finely
chiselled nose and opened the book, though with
but faint anticipation of interest. After a page or
two, however, he became absorbed, almost fascinated.
The writing appealed to him; it was pleasant,
cultured. There were here and there some
very neatly turned phrases. And then, quite suddenly,
one paragraph arrested his attention. It
was in itself a quite insignificant little paragraph
and merely descriptive. Here it is, however:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Near one corner of the house, grey-walled,
weather-beaten, stood a great pear-tree, its
branches almost touching the diamond-shaped
panes of the narrow window&mdash;the window of the
octagon room which held for him so many memories.
In spring-time the tree was a mass of
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>snowy blossoms, and among their delicate fragrance
a blackbird sang his daily matins. Later in the
year the tree would be full of fruit, many of which
fell to the ground, and, bruising in the fall, would
fill the air with a sweet and almost sickly scent. In
the trunk of the tree was a small shield-shaped
patch, where the bark had been torn away, and
the initials R. and J. cut in the smooth underwood.
They belonged, so the boy had been told, to the
twin brothers, whose gallant history had fascinated
him from childhood.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden paused. There was a look
of dim pain in his blue eyes. After a moment he
re-read the passage carefully, and with infinitely
more attention than the few sentences would
appear to merit. Then he turned to the title-page
and read the name of the author. Apparently
it told him nothing he desired to know, and
he continued his reading. Much farther on he
came to another paragraph at which he again
paused abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;&lsquo;Cricket,&rsquo; said the young man airily, &lsquo;is a
universal game, and means, speaking in general
terms, the avoidance of anything which&mdash;well,
hints of meanness or unfair play to our neighbours.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>They were his father&rsquo;s exact words, and he knew
it. At the moment, however, he chose to make
them his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden put down the book. His hands
were shaking slightly. He told himself he was an
old fool. Hundreds of fathers had used those
words to their sons. They represented the first
principle learnt by an Englishman. But then,
there was the pear-tree, the shield-shaped wound
in its bark, the initials, the old weather-beaten
house. Memory began to exert her sway. He
was sitting in a study window watching a tall,
slim woman as she laughed at a thin slip of a boy
climbing, monkey-like, among the branches of the
old tree. He could hear the very sound of her
laugh and the exultant ring of the boy&rsquo;s voice.</p>

<p class="indent">He pulled himself together. That house&mdash;the
old place down in the country&mdash;was in the hands
of caretakers. It did not do to think about the
past at his time of life. He was certainly perturbed
to use that phrase. He turned to the address
of the publishers, then glanced at the
telephone on his writing-desk and from it to the
clock. The hands pointed to ten minutes to ten.
Of course, it was too late to ring up a business
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>house, much too late. Besides, pseudonyms were
sacred to publishers, or should be. Quite possibly,
too, it was not a pseudonym. It was absurd
that he should suppose that it was. It was a good
book, however, a very good book. He should like
to see what the reviews had to say about it. It
was always interesting to hear public opinion on a
good book; and, to a certain extent, reviewers
constituted the public. There were places&mdash;he
had heard of them&mdash;where reviews were collected.
He must find out the name of one of them. Yes;
he would like to see whether the reviewers did not
endorse his own opinion. He would tell Mrs.
Cresswell he had appreciated her recommendation.
Possibly he would write a note to-morrow and tell
her. It would please her to hear that he had liked
the book she had advised him to read.</p>

<p class="indent">And then another thought struck him, and he
sat suddenly upright. Had not she once seen
that pear-tree&mdash;once, long ago? Surely she, too,
did not think&mdash;did not guess&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">He would not write to her after all. Tuesday
would be time enough to tell her that he thought
the book&mdash;yes, quite fairly promising for a new
author. Fairly promising, that was the expression.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</p>

<h3 class="no-break">A WONDERFUL OFFER</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Late</span> one afternoon Peter set off to walk to the
market-town. He was expecting a letter from his
publishers. He had given them the market-town
post-office as his permanent address. It was a
glorious day, and the sunlight lay warmly on the
fields.</p>

<p class="indent">During the day he had been writing, but his
work had not gone well. That which in brain-imagery
had seemed original and lifelike, in
articulation appeared to him commonplace and
dull. Who would care to read the drivel he was
committing to paper? His thoughts, his fancies,
of what interest would they be to the multitude?
Of what value even to two or three?</p>

<p class="indent">Peter was in a mood dangerous for his own creation.
His first book had come directly from his
inner being, written for the pure love of inscribing
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>in lucid words the thoughts which filled his brain.
The same reason had urged him to write again.
Then suddenly before him like a menace rose up
an image&mdash;the Public. His work would go out
to it, had already gone out to it. How would it
be received? And if with smiles the first moment,
who could tell whether the smiles might not the
next be changed to frowns?</p>

<p class="indent">He felt like a man whose chance witticism has
won him the post of Jester. What anxiety must
precede each lightly spoken word that follows;
the knowledge that the wings of spontaneity had
been clipped, though the knowledge perchance was
his alone; the inward wince at a rebuff, the joy
at applause! Jester to the many-faced public!
Was this to be his rÃ´le? Truly, if a little knowledge
be a dangerous thing, a little success appeared
quite as dangerous. Had he the strength to forget
his audience; to speak only as and when Inspiration
bade him; to keep silence when her voice was
still? If indeed he had to play the part of Jester,
could he be a daring one, heedless alike of frowns
and smiles? Could he risk the cap and bells
being taken from him? Could he bear hooting
and derision?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; cried Peter to his soul. &ldquo;I will jest
how and as I please. Servant will I be to Inspiration
alone, and slave to none. Away with
cowardice, Peter, my son, and dismiss the many-headed
public from your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">It was therefore in an extremely healthy frame
of mind that Peter approached the market-town.</p>

<p class="indent">The letter he had expected was awaiting him.
He put it in his pocket unopened, for he knew it to
be merely a business communication of no particular
importance, and set off once more for home.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not till after his supper that he again
thought of it, and he pulled it carelessly from his
pocket. Within the envelope was the typewritten
communication he had expected, and also
a letter. It was addressed to Robin Adair, Esq.,
care of the publishers.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter turned the letter over curiously. The
post-mark was London, the writing educated,
delicately firm. He broke the seal and drew the
letter from the envelope. Here is what he read:</p>

<blockquote><p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">London</span>.</p>
<p class="right">&ldquo;<i>May 16th</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This letter can have no formal beginning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>inasmuch as it is not written to a man, but to a
personality&mdash;the personality that breathes through
the book signed by Robin Adair. Nor, in spite
of appearances, is it a letter from a woman, but
from a personality as impersonal&mdash;if the contradiction
may pass&mdash;as that to which it is addressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in the first place I am trusting that you&mdash;for
impersonal as one may wish to be, one cannot
dispense with pronouns&mdash;that you are possessed
of sufficient intuition to discover that I am neither
an autograph-hunter nor one desirous of snatching
a sensation by stolen intercourse with a celebrity.
I am not greatly flattering your intuitive powers
therein; for nowhere is true personality so intimately
revealed as in an intimate letter. Art can
almost invariably be detected, and there is no
fleshly mask to dazzle the perceptions and obscure
the soul. An intelligent abstraction from a letter
would probably give the truest image of the subjective
side of any nature, which after all is the
side with which as an individual one is concerned.
If, therefore, after reading thus far, you are disposed
to regard this letter as an impertinence, then
it is one which is entirely without excuse, and I
should desire you to tear it up forthwith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If, on the other hand, you have preserved an
open mind so far, then I shall not attempt excuse,
but furnish you with reasons. In fancy or in
reality I have detected in your book, running
through its sweetness and underlying all its
strength, a great heart-cry for sympathy, the
cry of a lonely soul. What it is that has wounded
you I cannot tell, but I feel in every fibre that the
wound is there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I make you an offer&mdash;one of intimate
comradeship with one of another sex, under conditions
of such stringency as Plato&rsquo;s self might have
approved. I am a woman whom you have never
seen, whom you will never see, of gentle birth,
with a share at least of education and refinement,
and, moreover, one who has been so profoundly
moved and influenced by your writing that she
feels with an extraordinary degree of confidence
the existence of a mind-<i>rapport</i> between herself
and you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the moment that is enough. Should you
wish to accept my offer, write to me at an address
I shall subjoin, whence the letter will be forwarded
to me. On your side the compact must be marked
by one condition: you must pledge me your word
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>never to make any attempt to discover my identity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I dislike pseudonyms, I leave this letter
unsigned.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Peter laid the letter upon the table and stared
at it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Amazing!&rdquo; he ejaculated. Then he took it
up again. It was written on bluish paper, and
held the faintest&mdash;just the very faintest&mdash;hint of
perfume, lavender delicately fragrant.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And a woman,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;has written this
letter to me&mdash;to me!&rdquo; His brain whirled slightly.
There is no other description for its state at that
moment. Gradually it steadied itself. He began
to realize the reality of what had happened.
He was not dreaming: the letter was actually in
his hand, the words traced in a clear and fine
writing.</p>

<p class="indent">Impersonal, indeed! She&mdash;this unknown woman&mdash;might
call it so if she pleased. To Peter
it breathed personality, a personality vivid and
rare. Its intimate aloofness&mdash;again a contradiction&mdash;was
full of charm.</p>

<p class="indent">An autograph-hunter! Bah! had the merest
suspicion of such a thought crossed his mind he
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>would indeed have been unworthy so much as
to lay a finger upon the epistle.</p>

<p class="indent">To say that Peter was touched would be a poor
way of expressing the emotions that filled him.
For years, remember, he had lived in mind-isolation
from his fellow-men, and here out of the Invisible
came the offer of a soul-intimacy, delicately,
graciously made, and made by a woman.</p>

<p class="indent">That she was <i>grande dame</i> and beautiful his
every instinct told him. There was an undernote
of assurance about the letter that made the fact
convincing. It needed not her statement that
she was of gentle birth. Very assuredly she was
one accustomed to deference and homage. And
she had written thus to him. Wonderful!</p>

<p class="indent">Peter got up from his chair, his eyes alight
with pleasure. He went to a cupboard and took
out a bottle of port and a wine glass. These&mdash;like
the pyjamas&mdash;constituted part of the hall-mark
of civilization.</p>

<p class="indent">He had bought the wine with the intention of
drinking to the health of his published book,
but the inclination had passed. There is something
unsatisfactory about toasts drunk in solitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p class="indent">But now Peter knocked the red seal from the
cork and drew it from the bottle. He reseated
himself at the table and poured the wine into the
glass. He lifted it in his right hand, holding the
letter in his left. He approached the glass to
the letter, then raised it to his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;To my Unknown Lady!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten minutes later Peter pulled pen, ink, and
paper towards him. Oh, the joy of answering
this letter, the luxury of it!</p>

<p class="indent">And then he began to write, very simply and
directly, attempting no well-turned thought or
phrase, but writing as he would have spoken, from
his heart.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right">&ldquo;<i>May 18th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you, I wonder, have the smallest conception
of what your letter means to me? If
you have, then perhaps you will realize that my
&lsquo;thank you&rsquo; holds in the fullest sense all that those
two words can express. Yet please believe that
the cry you have detected in my writing escaped
from me unawares. Consciously to have made
such a plaint would to my mind have savoured of
cowardice. May the gods guard me from it!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does not Emerson say, &lsquo;It is vain to attempt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>to keep a secret from one who has a right to know
it; it will tell itself&rsquo;? Dare I believe that you
possess that right, that the same spiritual law
which has made you conscious of a mind-<i>rapport</i>
between us has given you the key to it? I accept
your offer from my heart. The condition shall be
strictly observed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly you do not greatly flatter my power of
intuition when you imagine me possessed of
sufficient intelligence to discover that you are
neither an autograph-hunter nor anything akin
to it. I should be a base dullard had such a
thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That my book pleases you affords me intense
pleasure. Fresh life will be instilled into my future
work by the hope that one day you will read it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My pen is halting. I write as I should speak,
and my tongue is unaccustomed to speech with a
woman of gentle birth. Fate has made of me a
recluse&mdash;a hermit. I do not revile her. She
gives me compensations of which your letter and
offer are not the least. Will you write again?</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robin Adair.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I am sorry you dislike pseudonyms.
This is one.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Peter re-read the letter carefully. He put it
in an envelope which he addressed &ldquo;To my Unknown
Critic.&rdquo; He enclosed this in a second
envelope, on which he wrote the address he had
been given. This again he enclosed with a brief
letter to his publishers, asking them to post the
enclosure in London. The next day he would take
it in to the market-town.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter leant back in his chair. Then he poured
himself out a second glass of wine, which he drank
slowly.</p>

<p class="indent">This was a gala night.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally he set down his glass and spoke aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Though the expense is entirely unjustifiable,
I shall buy a dress suit.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</p>

<h3 class="no-break">CHÃ‚TEAUX EN ESPAGNE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Henceforth</span> Peter walked daily to the post-office
in the market-town. And never perhaps
has author so eagerly awaited the sight of a letter
from his publishers.</p>

<p class="indent">For ten days, however, the journeys made by
him were fruitless, and he began to cast about
despairingly in his mind for the memory of anything
in his own letter that could have offended.
But he found nothing. His writing, during
these days, did not progress. He was too restless,
too anxious, to work quietly. Sometimes
he sat at his cottage door and piped. Occasionally
a small crowd of children would gather outside
the hedge, drawn by the magic of the music.
The ceasing of the pipe, or any movement on his
part, however, was the signal for them to scatter
like a flock of frightened sparrows, and he would
find the lane deserted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p class="indent">At last, one evening, his journey to the market-town
proved fruitful. A letter awaited him
there, also a box bearing the name of a London
tailor.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter returned across the fields at a fine pace,
the letter in his breast pocket, the box under
his arm. Arriving at his cottage, he unknotted
the string that tied it.</p>

<p class="indent">Some twenty minutes later, Peter, in well-cut
evening clothes and with a gleaming expanse
of white shirt-front, broke the seal of the letter.</p>

<p class="indent">You perceive he was a host, receiving in spirit
the woman who had deigned to consider him
worthy of notice. And now he held the letter
in his hand and saw once more the delicate, firm
writing.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">London</span>,</p>
<p class="right">&ldquo;<i>May 27th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;First I must thank you that you have not
misunderstood me. And now that the understanding
between us is complete, I can write
more freely, more fully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are a recluse. Perhaps you are to be
envied. I have been, and am, in the midst of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>that mumming-show society, where we all wear
gaily-coloured masks and jest with those around
us. We speak little as we feel, but largely as we
are expected to speak. Is it part of your compensation
that you need not speak at all? For
me, I am somewhat weary of the show. It is
very gaudy, and the music, I think, too loud.
You may ask why I attend it, and to that I have
no answer, except that custom demands it of me
as a right. How many people, I wonder, act not
according to their own individuality, but rather
as usage and those around them expect them to
act?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible, I wonder, to free oneself from
tradition, that closely fitting garment placed
upon us by our ancestors at birth, which becomes,
to the majority, as much part and parcel of ourselves
as our skin? Clothed in it, I attend dances,
dinners, bridge parties, and theatres, from which
I am at the moment recoiling with a kind of mental
nausea. Should I strip myself of the garment,
shall I not feel cold and shivery&mdash;in short, to use
a common phrase, feel &lsquo;out of things&rsquo;? And once
the garment is definitely discarded it may not be
so easily donned again; at all events, it might not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>fit so well. You, a writer, who in your solitude
think many thoughts, give me your opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercifully, custom has at least decreed that
I should spend some months in the country. In
a few days&rsquo; time I go down to it. There my
individuality resumes what I believe to be its
rightful sway. I have a garden. It is, as the
poet sings, a thing of beauty, and is to me a joy
for ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A summer evening in a flower-scented garden!
Can you&mdash;you writer of poetic prose&mdash;conceive
anything more full of charm and delight? I have
a bed of night-stocks&mdash;poor, dilapidated, withered
things in the daytime, and the despair of my
gardener. But in the evening on the terrace the
odour is entrancing&mdash;divine. My thoughts are
&lsquo;carried on the wings of perfume into high places.&rsquo;
You see, I can quote from your book and from
memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; the cry beneath its strength and sunshine
was faint, barely discernible. I confess
that at the first reading, which I took at a
draught, I did not observe it. It was when I
returned, as I did, to sip the wine of its poetic
fancy that I detected the slightly bitter taste.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>Yet bitter is not a fair word to use. Bittersweet
would be better, though that barely fits
the flavour. The exact word&mdash;if one exists&mdash;has
escaped me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You quote from Emerson, and also speak of
compensation. Of course, you know this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We cannot part with our friends. We cannot
let our angels go. We do not see that they
go out only that archangels may come in....
The compensations of calamity are made apparent
to the understanding also, after long intervals
of time.... It permits or constrains the formation
of new acquaintances and the reception of
new influences, that prove of the first importance
to the next years; and the man or woman
who would have remained a sunny garden-flower,
with no room for its roots and too much sunshine
for its head, by the falling of the walls and the
neglect of the gardener is made the banian of the
forest, yielding shade and fruit to wide neighbourhoods
of men.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your quotation made me look up my Emerson.
I found your sentence, and went on to read &lsquo;Compensation,&rsquo;
whence I have copied the above.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would your writing have been as human
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>were it not for the hidden wound you bear? Is
it some compensation to know that to one soul
at least your words have brought refreshment?
What are you writing now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like your pseudonym.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Peter read the letter through twice then put
it on the table while he prepared his supper.
He laid two places to-night, laughing at himself
for the fancy. His Unknown Lady was very
present with him, you perceive.</p>

<p class="indent">He pretended&mdash;and loved the pretence&mdash;that
she was dining with him. He let himself imagine
that a woman, clad in chiffon and lace, and fragrant
with that delicate scent of lavender, sat
in the chair opposite to him; that the candle-light
was playing on her warm hair, finding
reflection in her luminous eyes. No palace contained
a more courteous host that night than did
that little cottage; no royal guest received a
greater welcome than did Peter&rsquo;s Dream Lady.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a strange, fantastic little scene. Had
any one peered through the cottage window,
they would have seen a barely furnished room,
a meagre supper-table lit by a couple of candles,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>and, seated at the table, a man in well-cut evening
clothes&mdash;a man groomed with the fresh cleanness
of a well-bred Englishman. They would have
seen a second place laid at the table, and in the
second place, between the knife and fork, a bluish
letter lying. They would have seen both glasses
filled with red wine.</p>

<p class="indent">Mad? Not a bit of it! Peter was entirely
sane, and very refreshingly healthy. But&mdash;and
herein lay the difference between him and many
of his countrymen&mdash;he was possessed of a fine
imagination.</p>

<p class="indent">And when Peter had drunk the health of his
Dream Lady, he began to talk to her; and for
this purpose pen, ink, and paper came once more
into requisition.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right"><i>&ldquo;May 29th</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your first letter was welcome; your second is
ten thousand times more so. The first was the
mere fluttering of a signal, waved at a distance.
This evening you are near, and I can speak more
easily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the garment of tradition, I fancy it
may at times be discarded by ourselves and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>gently, and again donned without fear of it fitting
less well. In fact, may it not gain greater value
in our own eyes and in the eyes of others by its
temporary disuse? It is when fate strips it from
us, tearing it to ribbons in the process, that it
cannot again be worn, or worn merely as a sorry,
ragged semblance of what it once has been. It
is then, to use your own parlance, that one feels
&lsquo;out of things.&rsquo; I, who write to you, speak from
experience. Fate tore my garment from me,
and in so doing made the wound you have detected.
But enough of that. The touch of your
hand upon it has eased its smart, though possibly&mdash;nay
probably&mdash;the scar will remain throughout
my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for your quotation. Yes; I know
it. I am glad the shade of my banian-tree&mdash;a
very small one&mdash;has reached you, and its fruit
brought you refreshment. The &lsquo;ever-onward&rsquo;
note of Emerson is exhilarating. There is no repining,
no sitting down with folded hands under
grief, but an ever pushing forward to the light, as
a green shoot pushes aside earth and stones in its
journey upward through the soil to the sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am writing again; but the last few
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>days I have done little. I could not tear myself
away from the thought of the next letter I should
receive from you. Sometimes I feared that none
would come, that you might have regretted your
offer. It was an unworthy thought; forgive me.
Now, I shall write again quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ask what it is that I am writing. It
is the story of a man, a wayfarer. I do not think
there is much plot in the story. Probably all
the plot lies in the past which he has thrown
behind him. Fate has made of him a wanderer,
as she has made a recluse of me. During his
wanderings he thinks much. I am endeavouring
to record those thoughts as he traverses the fields
and lanes. If the gods are good to me, perhaps
one day the thoughts may reach you in book form.
Then you will give me your opinion on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon you will be among your night-stocks
in your garden. Their perfume will be more
fragrant than the scent of ballrooms and theatres.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robin Adair.</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I thanked you for your letter? I do
thank you from my heart.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h3 class="no-break">A REQUEST</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> evenings later Peter was again a host
holding sweet converse with his Lady. Here,
first, are her words to him.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">London</span>,</p>
<p class="right">&ldquo;<i>June 3rd</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The day after to-morrow I shall be in my
garden, revelling in its beauty and in the perfume
of my night-stocks. The scent of ballrooms
and theatres will be left behind in this
big noisy London. It has its fascination, though.
This morning the streets were bathed in sunlight,
and crowded with women in gay dresses
till they looked like a great restless nosegay.
We talk of &lsquo;Spring in the country,&rsquo; but here its
note is just as insistent. In February the Parks
were brilliant with crocuses, their hardy little
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>yellow, white, and purple flowers spreading far
under the trees. They were followed by daffodils
and tulips, masses of glorious colour. And for
sheer beauty give me a sunset across the Parks,
or the blue mists veiling the great masses of building.
Or, again, the river between sunset and
night. Have you ever walked along the Embankment
in the evening? I walked there yesterday.
Westward the river and sky flamed purple,
crimson, and gold; eastward a silver haze covered
land and water, with pale lights shining through
and reflected in the river. A small boy walking
with his mother exclaimed in rapture, &lsquo;Oh, mother,
look at the lights!&rsquo; &lsquo;What about them, dear?&rsquo;
came the reply. The matter-of-fact tone of the
words was indescribable. Thus is the early
glimmering of poetry effaced from the infant
mind. I write of it lightly. At the moment
indignation and tears struggled for the mastery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I read the following advertisement in a paper
the other day:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wanted, a bright sympathetic woman, not
necessarily under 25, as Companion-Help in
a family of three. No children, no washing,
but the ordinary work of the house to be done.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>Must be educated, as she is wanted to be one
of the family and help in philanthropic work.
Will be needed to do plain cooking, and a &ldquo;sense
of humour&rdquo; will be appreciated. Salary a matter
of arrangement. Protestant.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then followed the address. Doesn&rsquo;t it strike
you as rather funny? Can you imagine any one
sitting down solemnly to answer it? Testimonials
re a sense of humour!</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Madam, in my former situations my
sense of humour proved a great attraction. I
enclose extracts from references. &ldquo;Jane Smith
is the soul of wit.&rdquo; &ldquo;Our Companion-Help
kept us through meal-time in one perpetual roar
of laughter.&rdquo; &ldquo;Laughter is the best digestive
sauce. Jane Smith&rsquo;s humour provides that sauce!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you think I may at times discard
my garment of tradition. Now I come to think
of it, I believe I did discard it when I first wrote
to you. I do not think at that moment the
ancestral garment can have been upon me. Talking
of that first letter, will you do me a favour?
I want you to burn it. It was too solemn, too
serious, written with altogether too heavy a pen.
Something made me write it, and I am glad of it;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>but I was so anxious to place myself above the
possibility of a snub that my sense of humour was
for the moment obliterated. I took myself and
my own importance too seriously. Therefore
please destroy it, though it is quite possible that
you have already done so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to read the thoughts of your Wanderer.
They should be untrammelled thoughts, wide
as the open spaces he is traversing. <i>When</i> the
gods are good to you I shall look for a copy of
the book. I prefer my word to your &lsquo;if.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My next letter shall be written from my
terrace if the sunshine continues in this glory.
Good-night.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">The letter read, Peter repeated the little ceremony
of dining with, and toasting, his Lady.
He then proceeded to write to her.</p>

<blockquote><p class="right">&ldquo;<i>June 5th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Lady</span>,&mdash;Thank you for your letter.
Doubtless the Muses join with you in your tears
and indignation when they see their children
stifled at birth. I wonder what &lsquo;Mrs. Be-done-by-as-you-did&rsquo;
will have in store for those parents.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>Yet their intentions are probably of the very best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to see the answers that advertisement
will receive. Protestant and philanthropic
work, when advertised as such, seem
inconsistent with a sense of humour. The person
who answers the advertisement will either be
devoid of it, or possess it in a very marked degree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should the first favour you ask of me
be one I have not the heart to grant! I cannot
burn that letter. I should watch it shrivel and
twist in the flames like some protesting living
thing. It would be like burning the photograph
of a friend. Call me superstitious, idiotic, any
name you choose, but I can&rsquo;t do it. I will, however,
return it to you, though with great reluctance,
and you can do with it as you will.
Send me in exchange one of your night-stocks.
It will be less shrivelled than your letter had I
done as you ask.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Unknown Lady, when my next book
is published&mdash;you see, I accept your correction&mdash;have
I your permission to dedicate it to you?
With the exception of the first two chapters,
which were written before I knew you, it is written
to you and for you alone. My Wanderer speaks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>his thoughts directly to you, believing that they
will find favour in your sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though I have churlishly refused the favour
you asked of me, will you grant me this one?</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robin Adair.</span>&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Peter put the letter into an envelope and
addressed it. After a few minutes he came out
of the cottage into the little copse.</p>

<p class="indent">The June night was very still. The after-glow
from the sunset still lingered in the west;
the darkness would be of short duration.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly the sound of wheels struck on Peter&rsquo;s
ear, and the quick clear tang of horses&rsquo; hoofs
on the dry road. A few moments later a carriage
came into sight, and drove past him towards the
village. In spite of the dusk Peter saw that the
men on the box wore livery, and a lamp inside
the carriage gave him a glimpse of two women&rsquo;s
forms. A couple of boxes were strapped at the
back of the carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; said Peter to himself, &ldquo;it
is Lady Anne returning.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE LADY ANNE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> Anne Garland was sitting by a rosewood
writing-desk in her morning-room. She had finished
her letters, and was now sitting idle, gazing
through the window on to the terrace, and away
to the distant woods and hills, which lay serenely
blue in the sunlight.</p>

<p class="indent">She was dreaming rather than thinking, and
a pleasant little dream it would seem, by the half
smile in her grey eyes. The sunshine lay along
the floor in a broad, vivid patch. It fell across
her white dress and on her dark hair, which held
the blue-black sheen of a rook&rsquo;s plumage. Her
skin was creamy-white, and her mouth, modelled
like the mouth of a Greek statue, was of geranium
red. In fine, Lady Anne was beautiful.</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of the door opening made her turn
her head. A small thin woman entered. She
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>was dressed in a tailor-made dress of some pepper-and-salt
material, and wore a black straw hat,
rather floppy, and distinctly out of keeping with
her otherwise tailor-made appearance. Her hair
was grey, and her skin somewhat like parchment,
but her eyes and mouth were kindly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Finished your letters?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anne, getting up from her desk.
&ldquo;Come into the garden. It is too lovely a day
to waste indoors.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">She led the way through the French window
on to the terrace, and sat down on one of two
deck-chairs. Miss Haldane followed her example.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You should have a hat,&rdquo; she said abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Anne lazily, &ldquo;I like the sun. I
think my skin is too thick to burn. Look at
the blueness on those woods and hills; isn&rsquo;t it
glorious?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane put up her eyeglasses and looked
at the landscape.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Very nice, my dear. Jabez said the hay
harvest was unusually good this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Jabez was the head gardener.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne laughed softly. &ldquo;You are so delightfully
practical, Matty dear. If the sun shines
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>you think of the crops, if the rain falls you think
of the crops, if the wind blows you still think of
the crops. You missed your vocation when you
took up the post of companion to a sentimental
dreamer; you should have been a farmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Had the good Lord made me a man, I should
have been one,&rdquo; replied Miss Haldane instantly.
&ldquo;As it is, I take an interest in the farming of your
tenants. And you must allow that weather is
of the first importance to them.&rdquo; She dropped
her eyeglasses and looked at Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; owned Anne; &ldquo;but turnips do not
appeal to me. I love my flowers to have their
needs supplied, however; and that shows that
I am selfish enough to be merely interested in
what interests me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The cottage in the copse has found an inhabitant,&rdquo;
said Miss Haldane suddenly and abruptly.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t call him a tenant because the man pays
no rent. I suppose no one knows to whom the
rent would be due.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; exclaimed Anne, replying to the
first part of Miss Haldane&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;Who
has been bold enough to venture there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A vagabond of sorts, I believe,&rdquo; said Miss
Haldane. &ldquo;Of course, the villagers are looking
upon him with suspicion and distrust. He
wears a peacock feather in his hat and plays the
penny whistle.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;How pleasant!&rdquo; said Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane snorted. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you have him
turned out?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it
is a good plan to have a vagabond settling in
the village.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The cottage is not mine,&rdquo; replied Anne;
&ldquo;as far as I know, it is no man&rsquo;s property. Besides,
does he do any harm&mdash;poach, or anything
like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; returned Miss Haldane.
&ldquo;In fact, they say he buys, and pays for, certain
provisions at the village shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Anne lazily, &ldquo;he is not a vagabond.
A vagabond is one without visible means
of subsistence; this man evidently has visible
means. I wonder what he is like. I fancied
no man would have braved that cottage after
nightfall even if he had ventured within at daylight.
At all events, superstition has been very
rife around it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;They say he plays the penny whistle beautifully,&rdquo;
remarked Miss Haldane.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. &ldquo;You have culled much
information since our arrival last night, Matty
dear. The man shall come and give us a concert.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Anne carelessly. &ldquo;An
unstudied simple concert on the penny whistle
would, I am sure, be full of charm. Burton
shall go down to-morrow and request him from
me to come up to the terrace.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane was shocked, perturbed. In
a word, she fluttered in a manner not unlike an
elderly hen with a duckling chick.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You cannot do it, Anne. You cannot send
a footman to the cottage and ask the man to
come up here. In the first place, he is probably
a socialist, and wouldn&rsquo;t come. In the
second place&mdash;well, it isn&rsquo;t nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne laughed outright. &ldquo;Dear Matty, your
favourite adjective! With the negative prefix
it applies equally to a burnt pudding, or to a
woman who leaves her husband in order to
run away with another man. But you&rsquo;re a
dear, and I won&rsquo;t laugh at you; and you
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>shan&rsquo;t be present at the concert if you&rsquo;d rather
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane spoke a little stiffly. &ldquo;If you
will be foolish, Anne, I must be present at your
folly. It is the only way in which I can merit
the liberal salary you give me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Dear Matty, what nonsense!&rdquo; said Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">Again there was silence, and it lasted some
time. Butterflies flitted in the still air, bees
droned lazily in a lime-tree to the west of the
terrace, and once or twice a dragonfly skimmed
past with a flash of iridescent wings.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane looked at Anne lying back in
the deck-chair, which was placed at its lowest
angle. Her own was as upright as was consistent
with its nature. She had a piece of crochet
in her hands, and was working industriously.
Matilda Haldane was never idle, and she never
lolled. From her earliest years she had been
told to &ldquo;get something useful to do,&rdquo; if there
happened to be a single spare moment in the
ordinary routine of walks, meals, and lessons.
Later she was obliged, on her own account, to
get something useful to do, and to keep doing
it, if she was to live in the smallest degree as she
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>imagined a lady should live. There had been
nothing extravagant about Miss Haldane&rsquo;s ideas,
either, but they had included a seat in a church
where sittings were rented and threepence to be
placed Sunday morning and evening in the
offertory-bag.</p>

<p class="indent">The useful occupation which provided her with
a means of livelihood had been monotonous&mdash;how
monotonous only Miss Haldane knew. Then
suddenly, and by some intervention of providence,
Lady Anne Garland came across her path,
and at a moment when Lady Anne was&mdash;to use
her own parlance&mdash;tired of companions who were
either entirely opinionated or entirely deprecating,
or, worse still, who dissolved into floods of injured
tears if told that Anne wished to receive a guest
alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Something about the little dried-up woman&mdash;probably
her quiet and indomitable pluck under
adverse conditions&mdash;appealed to Anne. A month
after their first meeting, Miss Haldane found
herself transplanted to Anne&rsquo;s London house,
with a salary that far exceeded her wildest dreams.
The only fly in her ointment was the thought
that she did nothing to merit it. Merely to
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>live in a house, to be waited upon by servants,
to eat dainty food, and to drive with Anne in
the Parks, seemed to her an utterly inadequate
return for the money she received. It was,
however, all that Lady Anne wished her to do.
After a time she grew accustomed to the fact
that this was all that was expected of her. Her
own innate dignity and Anne&rsquo;s charming and
frank manner prevented her from feeling herself
a dependent, and an odd but very sincere friendship
was the result.</p>

<p class="indent">This was now the third summer that she had
sat on the terrace and watched Anne lazing in
the sunlight. Her beauty, her youthful vigour,
in spite of her present indolent pose, struck Miss
Haldane anew.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Miss Haldane spoke. &ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;I wonder you have never married.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of the luncheon gong followed on
the speech. Anne rose from her chair with
panther-like grace.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;So do I, Matty dear&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Miss Haldane.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne walked to the window. At the window
she turned. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; she said, mock-solemnity
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>in her voice, &ldquo;though few people realize it, I
have a soul.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course you have,&rdquo; replied Miss Haldane
seriously; &ldquo;but what has that got to do with
marriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne laughed. &ldquo;Nothing, of course,&rdquo; she
replied; &ldquo;and all the men I happen to know
would agree with you. Don&rsquo;t look puzzled,
Matty dear, but come and have lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</p>

<h3 class="no-break">A CONCERT&mdash;AND AFTER</h3>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peter</span> was partaking of a noonday meal of
bread and cheese and beer when a knock came
on his cottage door. For a moment or two he
thought his ears must have deceived him, and
he did not move. But the knock was repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter got up and opened the door. A man
in footman&rsquo;s garb was standing outside. He
looked Peter up and down with a slightly
supercilious expression.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; demanded Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The Lady Anne Garland wishes you to bring
your penny whistle-pipe to the terrace at four
o&rsquo;clock this afternoon, and be punctual,&rdquo; he
announced.</p>

<p class="indent">It was not precisely the formula in which
Lady Anne had worded the message, but Burton
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>considered it an exact enough paraphrase to be
delivered to a mere vagabond. It was in his
eyes an even over-courteous method of delivering
the message.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Four punctual,&rdquo; repeated the man with a
slightly insolent air. And he turned from the
door.</p>

<p class="indent">Had he lingered a moment longer Peter would
quite probably have kicked him. Astonishment
on Peter&rsquo;s part and a swift retreat on his alone
saved him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; ejaculated Peter, looking
after the retreating figure. Then he went into
the cottage and shut the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Insolence or fame,&rdquo; remarked Peter to his
glass of beer, &ldquo;in which light shall I regard it?&rdquo;
And then suddenly he laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">After all it smacked finely of medieval days,
this command from the lady of the manor to
appear before her. Annoyance began to vanish;
even the insolence of the flunkey was in the picture.
It was fame, there was no question about it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And, Robin Adair, you writer of tales, here&rsquo;s
a subject made to your hand,&rdquo; he quoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Oh, he&rsquo;d act the part well! A hint more disarray
than usual about his costume, his oldest
coat and trousers&mdash;he had two day suits now,
this possessor of a cottage&mdash;must certainly be
worn, with the peacock feather at its jauntiest
angle. He must also allow himself a slight
air of swagger, as of one conferring a favour;
in appearance the vagabond they regarded him,
in manner a Kubelik stepping with assurance
before his audience.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter began to be pleased; to look forward
to the appointed hour with interest. It was
the writer in him, the man who sees, in any
novel situation in which he may find himself,
new material for his pen.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Fate,&rdquo; quoth Peter to himself, &ldquo;is thrusting
another rÃ´le upon me.&rdquo; And then as children&mdash;and
grown-ups for the matter of that&mdash;count
cherry stones, he ticked them off on his fingers.
&ldquo;Gentleman, scamp, jail-bird, tramp, author,
writer of letters to an Unknown Fair One, and
piper to the lady of the manor. Peter, my son,
what else have the Fates in store for you?&rdquo;
And then he gave a little involuntary sigh, for
after all, was not the chief rÃ´le assigned to him&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>one which superseded all others&mdash;that of a
lonely man?</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; cried Peter to his heart. &ldquo;Does
not the sun shine for you, the wind blow for you,
and the birds sing for you? Have you not free
and untrammelled communion with Nature in
all her varying moods?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">But all the same the very enumeration of the
many rÃ´les seemed to have emphasized the one
more strongly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">At a quarter to four Peter, in his oldest and
shabbiest garments, with the peacock feather
extremely jaunty in his shabby felt hat and his
whistle-pipe in his pocket, set off for the white
house on the hill.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a still sunny day, like many of its predecessors
that summer. June had taken the
earth into a warm, peaceful grasp. There was
a restfulness about the atmosphere, a quiet assurance
of continued heat and sunshine. A
faint breeze came softly from the west, barely
stirring the leaves on the hedges. To the east
were great masses of luminous cloud, piled like
snow-mountains, motionless and still. The dust
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>lay thick and powdery in the lane, whitening
Peter&rsquo;s boots; the grass, too, was powdered, but
slightly, for there was little traffic this way.
Peter, to whom the passing of a vehicle was somewhat
of an event, barely ever counted more than
two or three in the day.</p>

<p class="indent">He left the lane behind him and came out
on to the village green. As he passed across
it men looked at him suspiciously, and a woman
carrying a basket stepped hastily to one side
as if she feared contact with him. Peter smiled
brilliantly, and raised his hat with an air of almost
exaggerated courtliness. One man spat on the
ground and muttered something that sounded
like a curse, but Peter went on his way apparently
unheeding.</p>

<p class="indent">He passed the lodge gates and went up the
drive, under beeches green, copper, and purple,
their trunks emerald and silver in the sunlight.
On the terrace to the right of the house he saw
two figures, one in white and one in some neutral
colour. As he drew near the white-robed figure
raised her hand, beckoning him to approach.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter came up to the terrace, standing just
below on the gravel path. He swept off his
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>hat and stood bareheaded. Then he looked
up and saw Lady Anne Garland watching him.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter&rsquo;s heart gave a jump, and for no reason
in the world that he could ascribe, beyond the
fact that she was beautiful, oh! but undeniably
beautiful. She was a young woman, tall and
slender, in a white dress, and a crimson rose
tucked in her waist-belt. She wore no hat. Her
hair shone blue-black, warm and lustrous in the
sun.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the other woman Peter took little note,
beyond observing that she was elderly and looked
at him with evident disapproval.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;So you are Peter the Piper?&rdquo; said Lady Anne
in her low, distinguished voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;At your service,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Anne looked at him curiously. He
was altogether different from what she had expected,
this man in the shabby clothes, with
the brilliant peacock feather, and with the bronzed
clear-cut face and sad eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We have heard,&rdquo; said Anne, and there was
an air of royal graciousness in the words, &ldquo;that
you are a marvellous piper. Are you willing
to pipe for us?&rdquo; She smiled at him as she spoke.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>And again Peter&rsquo;s heart jumped, and began to
beat at a fine rate.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;With all the pleasure in the world,&rdquo; he replied,
and he drew the pipe from his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne watched him as he laid his fingers lovingly
around it. For a moment or so he stood motionless.
And then he began to play.</p>

<p class="indent">First Anne heard an ordinary little march,
quite conventional, but sufficiently gay and
lively. Then it broke into curious discords
played in rapid succession. Next followed a
minor passage, tense, constrained, as if the strange
little air running through it were struggling for
greater liberty of expression. Suddenly it found
it, blending into a Te Deum, grand and glorious.
All at once it stopped, breaking again into a succession
of strange discords which hurt Anne to
hear. There was an instant&rsquo;s pause, as if the
first half of his theme were finished. Then, played
in the minor key, came a gay song with an under
note of marching feet, and through it a wistful
yearning as for something lost. The air changed
to the major, and was repeated. Then came a
little melody played quite separately and on its
own account, a little rocking melody, not unlike
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>a cradle song. It ceased, and a new theme began
quite unlike anything that had preceded it.
Anne listened with suspended breath. She made
no attempt to classify it as she had classified his
previous themes. But above and beyond all the
others it spoke directly to her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly she was aware that the music
had stopped, and that Peter was looking at
her like a man who has just come out of a
trance.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne&rsquo;s eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said, and she held out her
hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter came forward and took it. Then&mdash;it
seemed that the action was almost involuntary&mdash;he
raised it to his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane fairly gasped, sitting upright
and grasping the supports of the deck-chair with
both hands. The effrontery! the audacity! the&mdash;the&mdash;she
had no further word in her vocabulary
with which to express her indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet if Lady Anne were displeased she did not
show it. She looked at Peter long and curiously,
as if seeking for something she might find, something
that escaped, eluded her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You will come and play to me again?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Peter thoughtfully. He seemed
not yet fully recovered from what had appeared
like a trance.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane made an inarticulate sound in
her throat. This assuredly surpassed everything.
She had been right, quite right, when she had
considered he might be a socialist.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It must of course,&rdquo; said Anne courteously,
&ldquo;be exactly as you wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter bowed, and the next moment moved
away, walking down the avenue of beeches.
Anne looked after his retreating figure thoughtfully,
wonderingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Impudence!&rdquo; gasped Miss Haldane. She
felt that her goddess, her divinity, had been
insulted.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No, Matty dear,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;the man is an
artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;An artist!&rdquo; said Miss Haldane. She was
unwilling to allow that the music had appealed
to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Anne, musing, &ldquo;an artist!
Heaven knows how many faults of construction
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>there may not have been in his theme. Possibly
had I been educated in the technical knowledge
of music I should have found it positively
bristling with them. I am glad I know nothing
of the technique of music. I could listen and
appreciate. Don&rsquo;t you understand, Matty dear,
how wonderful it was! The man&rsquo;s a genius!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated Miss Haldane. She got up
and moved towards the French window. Before
entering she turned suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;you never paid
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Lady Anne quietly.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Peter walked back to his cottage with his mind
in a turmoil.</p>

<p class="indent">It had been utterly, entirely different from
the scene he had pictured to himself. He had
not swaggered, he had not stepped on to his
platform with an air of assurance. Something
had gripped him, something indefinable and
powerful, and he&mdash;Peter&mdash;had lost the strength
to assert his own personality.</p>

<p class="indent">It had been there, sure enough, but swayed,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>dominated, by something outside, beyond him.
It had come out from himself, forced out it
would seem, into the music of his piping. He
had played himself, his own story, to this woman
on whom he had never before set eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet did he not know her? Had he never
before seen her? Peter searched the recesses of
his memory, penetrating to its remotest corners,
but with no avail.</p>

<p class="indent">No; in spite of all searching memory remained
a blank. Instinct, intuition&mdash;call it what you
will&mdash;said, &ldquo;You know this woman.&rdquo; Reason
said as firmly, &ldquo;You do not.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He had reached his cottage by now. He went in
and shut the door. He would work. He wanted
to soothe his mind. He would throw himself into
the quiet calm thoughts of his Wanderer.</p>

<p class="indent">He pulled paper, pen, and ink towards him
and turned resolutely to his manuscript. For
over an hour he sat with it before him, then
suddenly realized that he had written no single
word. It was useless to attempt to write in this
mood. A vague unrest was upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter pushed the papers aside, and leaving the
cottage, set off to walk across the moorland.</p>

<h3 class="no-break">A DISCLOSURE</h3>

<blockquote><p class="center2"><i>The Unknown Critic to Robin Adair</i></p>

<p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Terrace</span>,</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<i>June 8th</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Here</span>, Robin Adair, is a night-stock from below
my terrace. I enclose it while it is white
and fragrant. It will reach you brown and
shrivelled; but, as you say, less shrivelled than
my letter would have been&mdash;in fact, as it now
is. It lies on the terrace beside me, a little
heap of grey powdered ashes. This flower is its
resurrected form. It is slighter, subtler, more
fragrant than that letter. I began to re-read it,
but did not get far; it was too serious, Robin
Adair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, as the above will have told you, writing
from my terrace in the cool of the evening. A
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>lamp in the window of my morning-room affords
me light. The sky is grey-blue, and away in the
west, Venus, who is an evening star at the moment,
is shining calm and peaceful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a concert on this very terrace yesterday
afternoon. A so-called vagabond piped to
me, wearing shabby clothes and a peacock feather
in his hat....&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">Peter laid down the letter a moment. His
brain was whirling. Not even on the receipt
of the first letter from his Lady had it whirled
with such rapidity. Here, then, was the explanation.
Of course, he had known her before. He
had had glimpses of her mind, her soul, her delicate
fanciful imaginings. She had embodied suddenly
before him, and unconsciously his soul had recognized
her, though reason had urged to the contrary.
It was incredible, marvellous! In actual
everyday life such things did not happen. Yet
here was the proof thereof, finely, clearly traced
with black ink on a sheet of bluish note-paper.</p>

<p class="indent">He picked up the letter again, and began to read
further.</p>

<blockquote><p class="no-indent">&ldquo;It was a wonderful concert. Music has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>never before so stirred, so moved me. Picture
to yourself an ordinary penny whistle, from
which divine music was produced. He told a
life-story in his piping, yet fragmentary sentences
alone reached me. It was as if I were reading
a book in a language of which I knew but a few
words. Can you understand?</p>

<p>&ldquo;What there was in the first part of his theme,
I know not; but he, that strolling player, had
suffered. Part of his theme beat and struggled
for liberty like a caged bird, or like an imprisoned
mind&mdash;a fettered expression. And when the expression,
the liberty came&mdash;that was what hurt&mdash;it
was smashed, broken. Can you picture a
caged skylark, longing, pining for liberty, then
seeing the cage door open, and flying forth into
the sunlight, its throat bursting with rapture,
only to find itself seized by some ruthless hand,
wings torn from its body? Yet the bird was not
dead; there was the horror. It lay still, bleeding,
apparently lifeless, then lifted its head. Maimed
though it was, it would still sing; and its song
should be no complaint, but one to encourage and
cheer all other injured things. I could have wept
for the pluck, the courage of the little creature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>And after a time it began to grow wings&mdash;little
young wings that carried it just above the earth
into the open it loved. It was only a little way,
but it meant such a lot to that skylark. It was
here, at the end, that the music spoke most
directly to my heart. The song the partially
healed skylark sang seemed to be sung for me
alone, and yet here the translation of the words
most failed me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The man is an artist. I wish he would play
for me again. Yet I dare no more ask him now
than I would dare ask Sarasate to come to my
terrace and play.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;this piper&mdash;is living on the outskirts
of the village, in a cottage reputed to be haunted.
Doubtless he has charmed and soothed the restless
spirits by his piping. This is a great deal
to write to you regarding an unknown strolling
player&mdash;though he is not strolling now&mdash;but the
man himself is unusual, while his music is superb.
He struck me as one of gentle birth. His speech
was educated, and his whole appearance, in spite
of his shabby clothes, refined. I am sure he has a
story&mdash;one, Robin Adair, that might be worthy
of your pen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My companion&mdash;a dear, but very old-fashioned&mdash;resented
his behaviour. She thought he did
not treat me with sufficient respect, mainly because
he did not jump at the proposal of playing
to me again. I did suggest I should like to hear
him; but to send for him again, to send a footman
to fetch him as I did before, would be impossible.
I hope Burton delivered my message nicely. I
worded it courteously, at all events.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How goes your Wanderer, and are his thoughts
progressing? That you should dedicate those
thoughts to me pleases me immensely. I think
it an honour that you should care to do so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad you did not burn my letter. I am
glad you cared enough about it&mdash;poor dull thing
though it was&mdash;to refuse to do so. I did not
mean to say this to you, yet I have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="center2"><i>Peter (alias Robin Adair) to the Unknown Critic,
whom he now knows to be the Lady Anne
Garland</i></p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<i>June 10th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Lady</span>,&mdash;I am in a contrary frame of
mind to-night. I want to write to you, yet am
in no mood to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I have met your vagabond piper, and know
him more intimately than you might suppose.
He is an impostor, though a harmless one, I
grant. His music is not bad, but I doubt his
playing to you again. The fellow has a good
conceit of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all, I find I cannot write to-night.
Thank you for the flower.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Robin Adair.</span>&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="center2 no-indent"><i>The Unknown Critic to Robin Adair</i></p>

<p class="right2">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The Terrace</span>,</p>
<p class="right">&ldquo;<i>June 18th</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you so hard on my Piper? I do not
believe he is an impostor. And as for his music
being not bad! Robin Adair, are you one &lsquo;who
has no music in him, and is not moved by concord
of sweet sounds,&rsquo; or in what way has this man
vexed you? The latter I believe to be the solution,
Robin Adair, and it is not worthy of you.
But I will not write more of him. I have not seen
him again, and the villagers speak of him with
bated breath as a friend of the Evil One. If he
were of my faith, I would ask Father Lestrange, a
kindly man, to call at the cottage. But as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>never hears Mass he is evidently of another way of
thinking, and might regard the visit as an intrusion.
And for some reason he desires solitude.
One dare not therefore intrude. I feel, however,
that he is lonely, and have had, perhaps foolishly,
a desire to lessen that loneliness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The country is very peaceful after London,
and I am revelling in my flowers, more especially
my roses. They are adoring this unwavering
sunshine and the warm nights. The gardeners
keep their roots well watered, so they&mdash;the roses&mdash;do
not suffer from thirst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had a letter from a friend of mine the other
day, a woman with a surplus of relations all eager
and willing to offer good advice and to point out
various neat and narrow little paths in which she
should walk and from which her soul recoils.
After remarking on their latest suggestions, she
writes succinctly: &lsquo;The patience of Job was over-estimated.
His relations died.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are some people so sure that their plan is
the right one, and why cannot they allow others
to go their own way, provided, of course, the way
does not run strictly counter to the law? In that
case, of course, there might be complications.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I being very unoriginal when I lament
the little originality there is in the world, or, at
all events, in that portion of it which I know?
And what little there is, is so frequently mere
eccentricity. I believe some people would call
it original to discard one&rsquo;s clothes and walk down
Bond Street in war-paint and feathers, though
certainly there would be a large majority who
would call it merely indecent, and in that case the
majority would doubtless be right. I believe I
am in a discontented mood this afternoon. There
is a discord somewhere in my harmonies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you in a better mood for recording the
thoughts of your Wanderer than for writing to
me? I hope so. I am looking forward to reading
them. I want something to soothe me. In
spite of the peace that lies around me&mdash;the quiet
peace of Nature&mdash;I am restless.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Write to me, Robin Adair; tell me of your
Wanderer.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="center2"><i>Robin Adair to his one time Unknown Critic, or
Peter the Piper to the Lady Anne Garland</i></p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<i>June 20th.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Lady</span>,&mdash;I was churlish when I last wrote.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>I know more of your Piper than you suppose.
Do not write to me of him, I beg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for my Wanderer, he has escaped me. I
intended to keep him entirely to the fields and
lanes, but he is off now to a hilltop. He has
caught a glimpse of a star, and thinks to gain
a closer vision of it from the hill. Poor fool!
What will the height of an ant-heap advantage
him? There are millions of miles between him
and the star. On the hill he will be restless and
miserable that he is no nearer. Why could he
not keep his eyes to the attainable?&mdash;the wayside
flowers, the green leaves of the hedges, all that
which is common property to prince and peasant
alike.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long ago in his past&mdash;I told you he had a
past which he had thrown behind him&mdash;he cut
himself off from communion with his fellow-men.
He did not realize at the moment how complete
the severance would be; yet, if he had, I believe
he would have acted as he did. There seemed
then nothing else that he could do; even now there
appears to him nothing else. Maybe he made a
great mistake. If he did, he did not suffer alone,
there were others who suffered too; there&rsquo;s the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>rub. He did not realize that they would suffer.
His optimism in human nature was too great.
Now he realizes that there are only the fields and
roads for him, only the companionship of birds,
beasts, and flowers, to whom his past is unknown
and can never be disclosed. His wings were torn
from him like the wings of that skylark of which
your vagabond Piper piped. True, he, too, grew
new wings with which he could rise just far enough
above the earth to see the star. But he can
never reach it, and, unlike your skylark, he cannot
sing cheerfully. Perhaps before he saw the
star he might have done so, but now his song lacks
buoyancy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy I shall have to leave him for a while
gazing disconsolately at his star, and start a
new book. He has endowed me with too much
of his present mood, and who will care to hear
the pinings of a wanderer for the unattainable?
I might bring him from the hilltop, blot out the
star from the sky. I have, indeed, already tried
to do so, but my Wanderer has moped and
sulked. That is the worst of these fiction people.
You feed them with your heart&rsquo;s blood, you give
them life of your life that they may move as living
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>creatures and not as mere puppets pulled by
strings, and suddenly they escape you. The
path you have carefully chosen, in which they are
to tread, is refused by them. &lsquo;It is the way you
have chosen,&rsquo; they will cry, &lsquo;not the way we
choose!&rsquo; And if you protest that their path
will be of little interest to the public, they sulk,
insisting that, interest or no interest, it is the
true path. I will leave this flesh and blood
creature on the hilltop. If he bewails the distance
of his star from him, I will not record his
wailings. I will fashion a puppet, and merely
a puppet, and from first to last chapter I will
pull the strings myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Therefore I fear that the thoughts of my
Wanderer will never be printed to soothe you,
nor, I fear, can I be of much use in the matter.
I told you he had endowed me with his thoughts.
I might be the man himself. He has obsessed
me. I tell myself that I will look at his star and
worship it from afar, thankful for its benign rays.
But his restlessness is upon me. I want to get
near it, though I recognize the futility of my
desire. I am a fool.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I take your friend, with her many relations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>as the puppet for my next story? I will
pull the strings deftly, and she shall dance away
from them or frolic on their mangled corpses.
Which think you she would prefer?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find that again my mood for letter-writing
is not of the most cheerful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Robin Adair</span>,&mdash;What is it, I wonder,
that has disturbed us both? Some small and
unpleasant breeze has ruffled the surface of
our mind&rsquo;s lake. Yet your course seems clear.
Since your Wanderer desires his star, let him
attain it. Let him build a ladder of moonbeams
and climb up to it, or if he is too much flesh and
blood, too material, for such a feat, let the star
descend to him. Are there not falling stars?</p>

lonely. I go to town next Thursday to stay

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</p>

<h3 class="no-break">A MOONLIGHT PIPING</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> Anne Garland was sitting by her bedroom
window. It was wide open, and the perfume
of the night-stocks below the terrace rose
fragrant in the still air. The atmosphere was
darkly luminous, blue and purple, in which the
shapes of the trees and bushes stood out softly
black in the light of a half-moon.</p>

<p class="indent">Away across the park, with its scattered oaks
and beeches, she could see masses of woodland
lying like dark patches on the distant hills. In
the valley the lights in the cottages had been
extinguished. One by one they had dropped
into the darkness, and now the whole village
lay asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne leaned her arms on the window-sill and
looked out into the night. She had not yet
begun to prepare for bed, and she still wore the
silver-grey dress she had put on for dinner.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>The light from two candles on the dressing-table
behind her illumined the room, glinting
on silver-backed brushes and silver-topped bottles.
The walls of the room were white, and above the
bed hung an ebony crucifix with a silver Figure.
The black cross stood out in startling relief on
the white wall-paper. A table beside her bed
held a bowl of crimson roses, an unlighted reading-lamp,
and a green-covered book, the title printed
in gold letters. Between the leaves was an ivory
paper-cutter. The leaves, however, had long
since been cut; and for the sixth&mdash;the seventh&mdash;time
Anne was reading <i>Under the Span of the
Rainbow</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Suddenly Anne&rsquo;s ear was arrested by a sound&mdash;a
faint sound, but the unmistakable crunch of
feet on gravel. The sound came from the drive.
She drew back into the room, extinguishing
one candle and moving the other so that its
light did not illumine the square of open window.
Then from behind the curtain she watched and
listened.</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of the feet drew nearer, and a
man emerged from the shadow of the trees in
the drive. He walked unfalteringly. It was
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>not the wary approach of one who fears to be
seen.</p>

<p class="indent">Below the terrace he halted. Anne quickly
extinguished the second candle, and leant a little
from her hiding-place by the curtain. The man
looked up, the moonlight falling full on his face,
and Anne saw that it was Peter the Piper. Her
breath came quickly and she watched, herself
unseen.</p>

<p class="indent">She saw him lift his pipe to his lips, and then
the still night became full of music. This time
Anne made no attempt to classify his theme&mdash;to
read a story in the melody. Probably it held
none. It was music&mdash;music pure and simple,
which the Piper was playing for her alone.</p>

<p class="indent">Breathless, entranced, she stood and listened.
Surely never was such a piping since King Midas
of old listened to the flutes of Pan. It was truly
Nature&rsquo;s music, the instrument which produced
it forgotten. Liquid, caressing, it rose and fell
in soft cadences, yet faintly through it throbbed
the undernote of pain.</p>

<p class="indent">How long it lasted Anne did not know. Suddenly
there was a pause. Then came the nightingale&rsquo;s
song, one short phrase of pure rapture.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>Then silence. Anne saw Peter standing still in
the moonlight.</p>

<p class="indent">On a sudden impulse she moved and pulled a
half-blown crimson rose from the bowl on the
table near her bed. She threw it from the
window and saw it fall at his feet. She saw him
stoop and raise it from the ground to his lips.
He looked up, and once more she saw his face.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne turned swiftly into the room. A moment
later there was again the sound of feet on the
gravel, a clear, crisp crunching which receded
in the distance.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</p>

<h3 class="no-break">LE BEAU MONDE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> Anne Garland was sitting in Mrs.
Cresswell&rsquo;s drawing-room. It was a charming
room, with its domed ceiling, its panelled walls,
its long windows, its curtains and brocades of
dull orange and glowing brown, with its porcelains,
its bronzes, and its masses of yellow and
white roses in old china bowls and slender glasses.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne herself, in a dress of some gleaming
material, pale primrose in colour, was sitting
on an Empire sofa. The warm brown of its
brocade made a delightful harmony with the
colour of her dress&mdash;in fact, she looked entirely
in keeping with her surroundings. A white-haired
man, with blue eyes and wearing faultless
evening clothes, was sitting on the sofa beside
her; and Anne was asking herself where in the
name of wonder she had seen him before. Something
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>in his manner seemed familiar, or was it,
perhaps, his eyes, his keen old blue eyes under
their shaggy eyebrows? He had been introduced
to her early in the evening, and somehow there
had seemed at once a curious and indefinable
sympathy between them, one which had sprung
to life with the first conventional words they
had uttered. Throughout the evening he had
monopolized her&mdash;unquestionably monopolized
her&mdash;yet entirely without appearing to do so.
And over and over again Anne was asking herself
when and where she had seen him before.</p>

<p class="indent">She glanced at him now as she slowly waved
her fan&mdash;a delicate thing of mother-of-pearl and
fine old cobwebby lace softly yellow with age.
Anne possessed the trick of fan-waving in its
subtlest form, a trick&mdash;or art&mdash;she had inherited
from an ancestor of more than a century ago, one
Dolores di Mendova, a very noted beauty of
the Spanish court, from whom Anne had also
inherited her hair, her creamy skin, and her
panther-like grace.</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden turned and saw that she was
watching him. A faint rose colour tinged the
ivory of Anne&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I was wondering,&rdquo; she said, explanatory,
&ldquo;where it was that I had seen you before.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden smiled, a gay old smile. &ldquo;I
can tell you where I have seen you, though
whether you have deigned to notice me is quite
another matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; queried Anne the fan fluttering to
and fro.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I have frequently seen you driving in the
Park,&rdquo; said General Carden. &ldquo;You in your
carriage, I in my car.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; mused Anne, still doubtful.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You do not remember?&rdquo; asked General
Carden. He was frankly disappointed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;On the contrary, I remember perfectly. I
confess I had forgotten the fact till you
mentioned it. Yet somehow it does not quite
explain&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Explain?&rdquo; asked General Carden.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne laughed. &ldquo;Explain the quite absurd
notion that I have actually spoken to you before.
Something in your manner, your speech, seems
almost familiar. I fancied I must have known
you&mdash;not intimately, of course, but slightly.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; he regretted, &ldquo;that I have not had
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>that pleasure. I shall hope now to be able to
make up for my previous loss. You live in
town?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The greater part of the year,&rdquo; said Anne.
&ldquo;I spend three or four months in the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Which, no doubt, you like,&rdquo; replied General
Carden courteously. &ldquo;Being young, you are
able to enjoy it. I prefer London. I only leave
town during August, when I go abroad. And
the whole time I wish I were in England. An
unprofitable method of spending a yearly month
of one&rsquo;s life. Once I&mdash;&rdquo; He broke off. &ldquo;I
am too old for travelling now,&rdquo; he ended.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather&mdash;nonsense?&rdquo; said Anne,
with a faint hint of a smile, and glancing at
the upright figure beside her.</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden straightened his shoulders.
She was candid&mdash;absolutely candid&mdash;in her
remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Very charming of you to suggest it, Lady
Anne,&rdquo; he said, and he tried unavailingly to
keep the pleasure out of his voice. &ldquo;Perhaps
after all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; smiled Anne, &ldquo;after all, you don&rsquo;t find
it quite as disagreeable as you pretend.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pleasant little silence. Anne
watched the groups of people in the room, sitting
or standing in intimate conversation. There
was an atmosphere of airy gaiety about the
place, a lightness, an effervescence. Listlessness
or boredom was entirely absent. In one of the
farthest groups was her friend, Muriel Lancing,
with whom she was staying. She was an elfin-like,
dainty figure in a green dress, on which
shone a brilliant gleam of diamonds. Muriel
herself was sparkling to-night like a bit of escaped
quicksilver.</p>

<p class="indent">Rather nearer was another woman, tall and
massive. Her figure was undoubtedly good,
but her pose gave one the faintest suspicion that
she was conscious of that fact. She reminded
one of a statue which had become slightly animated
by some accident. Apparently, too, she
had never forgotten the fact of having been a
statue, and wished other people not to forget
it either. Her face was a faultless oval, and
her hair worn in a Madonna-like style. But
beyond the oval and the hair the Madonna-like
impression ceased. Her face was hard, there
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>was none of the exquisite warmth, the tender
humanity seen in the paintings of the Virgin
Mother.</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden was also looking at Mrs.
Sheldon, whom, it may be remembered, he had
seen on a previous occasion in the Park, a day
now three or four weeks old. Anne noticed the
direction of his glance.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do you know her?&rdquo; she asked suddenly,
then added as an afterthought, &ldquo;She is a friend
of mine.&rdquo; Anne did not state that it was a
friendship of only two years&rsquo; standing, and one
which existed infinitely more on Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s
side than on her own.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I once had the honour of knowing her fairly
intimately,&rdquo; replied General Carden. &ldquo;We still
exchange bows and civil speeches, but&mdash;well,
I fancy I remind her of an episode she wishes to
forget&mdash;a perfectly unimpeachable little episode
as far as she was concerned, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne glanced at him sideways. There was
almost a hard note in his voice, which had not
escaped her. She saw his profile clean-cut
against the dark panelling of the room. And
then a sudden little light of illumination sprang
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>to her eyes. She had all at once discovered of
whom it was he reminded her. There was in
his fine old face a very distinct look of the vagabond
Piper. It was one of those indefinable
likenesses which nevertheless exist, at all events
in the eyes of those who chance to see it. It
was faint, elusive, and to the majority it probably
would not be the least apparent, but Anne
now knew that it was this which had puzzled her
throughout the evening.</p>

<p class="indent">And with the discovery came a sudden mental
picture of a man standing in the moonlight with
a crimson rose against his lips. It was a picture
that had presented itself many times to her
mental vision during the last few days, and as
many times had been dismissed. It was apt
to make her heart beat a trifle faster, to make
the warm colour surge faintly to her face. Being
unable&mdash;or unwilling&mdash;to account for a certain
picturesque, if too impetuous, impulse which
had moved her that moonlight night, she wished
to forget it. Yet it had a disturbing way of representing
itself before her mind.</p>

<p class="indent">In banishing it now her thoughts turned into
another trend, which was apt to absorb them
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>quite a good deal, the thought of that writer
of letters and books&mdash;Robin Adair. Anne was
perfectly aware that this unknown writer occupied
a large amount of her mind; it swung and see-sawed
between him and the vagabond Piper in a
way that was almost uncomfortable and altogether
unaccountable. She was not accustomed to have
her thoughts encroached on in this way without
her will being consulted, and she could not understand
it, or she told herself that she could not
understand it, and that possibly came to the same
thing. At all events, she was undoubtedly in a
slight puzzlement of mind. It is the only word
to describe her vaguely perplexed state. As now
Robin Adair had swung uppermost, his book
presented itself to her as a subject of conversation.</p>

<p class="indent">She asked General Carden if he had read it.
She fancied&mdash;it was probably pure fancy&mdash;that
he started slightly. He glanced, too, at Mrs.
Cresswell, who was only a few paces away and
quite possibly within earshot.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; he replied indifferently. &ldquo;Mrs.
Cresswell recommended it to me&mdash;a fairly promising
book, I thought.&rdquo; He was adhering
faithfully to the expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Fairly promising!&rdquo; Anne&rsquo;s voice held a note
akin to indignation. &ldquo;I thought it delightful;
clever, cultured, quite admirably written.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden experienced a sensation which
might be described as a glow of satisfaction.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;rather high praise?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Not an atom more than the book deserves!&rdquo;
responded Anne warmly. &ldquo;And the reviews on
it&mdash;I saw two or three&mdash;were excellent.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said General Carden politely. The
old hypocrite had no mind to mention that every
review ever penned on it was now lying safely
locked in his desk, that he knew them all nearly
verbatim, that he had gloated over them, exulted
over them though with many a little stab of pain
in the region called the heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; pursued Anne thoughtfully, &ldquo;it
isn&rsquo;t merely a surface book, full of adventure,
movement, and incident; and what incident
there is might be termed improbable by those
who don&rsquo;t realize that nothing is improbable,
nothing impossible. It&rsquo;s in its style, its finish, its&mdash;its
texture that the charm and beauty of it lie.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It has certainly some well-turned phrases,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>conceded General Carden magnanimously. He
liked her to talk about the book; he longed for
her to continue, though for the life of him he
could not give her a lead. Yet his grudging
admiration&mdash;all a pretence though it was, though
Anne could not know that&mdash;fired her to further
defence of the writing, stimulated her to fresh
praise.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;There are delightful phrases!&rdquo; she said
emphatically. &ldquo;It is a modern book, yet with
all the delicacy, the refinement, the porcelain-air
of the old school. For all that the scenes are
laid mainly in the open, and are, as I said, quite
modern; it breathes an old-world grace, a kind
of powder-and-patches charm, which makes one
feel that the writer must have imbibed the finish,
the courtesy of the old school from his cradle, as
if it must have come to him as a birthright, an
inheritance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden drew himself up. His blue
eyes were shining. &ldquo;Your praise of the book,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;is delightful. The author&rdquo;&mdash;his eyes
grew suddenly sad&mdash;&ldquo;would, I am sure, be
honoured if he knew your opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne flushed. Did he not know? Had she
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>not told him? Though perhaps not in those
very words.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It does surprise me,&rdquo; she, allowed, after a
second&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;that you are not more enthusiastic
about it. I should have fancied somehow&mdash;slightly
as I know you&mdash;that it would have
entirely appealed to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden gave a little cough. &ldquo;It does
appeal to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It appeals to me
greatly&mdash;so much, in fact, that I assumed a
certain disparagement in order that I might
have the pleasure of hearing you refute me.&rdquo;
He had forgotten Mrs. Cresswell, but the words
had not escaped her, absorbed though she appeared
to be in conversation, and there was the
tiniest&mdash;the very tiniest&mdash;expression of triumph
in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Anne, at once puzzled and debating.
And then she said, &ldquo;I am longing to read his
next book.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He has not published another, then?&rdquo; queried
General Carden carelessly. Double-faced that
he was, he knew perfectly well that no second
book had appeared as yet. Had he not advised
Mudie&rsquo;s&mdash;naturally not in Mrs. Cresswell&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>presence&mdash;to supply him with a copy the moment
one appeared?</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Anne. And she stopped. Had
not Robin Adair himself told her that his Wanderer
had escaped him, and Heaven knew whether he
would ever again be caught, chained, fettered, and
imprisoned in the pages and between the covers
of a book?</p>

<p class="indent">Later in the evening General Carden, taking
his departure, said to Anne, &ldquo;I should like to
have the honour of calling on you, if you will
allow me to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And Anne replied: &ldquo;I should be quite delighted.
I am staying now with Mrs. Lancing,
and go down to the country in a few days, but
I shall return to town to my own house in the
autumn.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;In the autumn, then,&rdquo; said General Carden,
bowing over her hand.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</p>

<h3 class="no-break">CONFIDENCES</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Muriel</span> Lancing, having partaken of breakfast
in her own room, was now lying in luxurious
and dainty <i>nÃ©gligÃ©</i> among a pile of extremely
snowy pillows. Anne, who had breakfasted in
the dining-room some half hour previously, was
sitting by the open window talking to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Anne,&rdquo; said Muriel suddenly, glancing at
her from beneath lowered eyelashes, &ldquo;I believe
I owe you a confession and an apology.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; queried Anne, smiling. &ldquo;And for
what?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; confessed Muriel, &ldquo;one bit ill
when I wrote to you. I was only mentally sick
because I wanted Tommy, and he had to go
away on horrid business where I couldn&rsquo;t accompany
him&mdash;at least, he said I couldn&rsquo;t; and that
comes to the same thing&mdash;with Tommy.&rdquo; Muriel
heaved a prodigious sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; laughed Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel wrinkled her porcelain-like brows. &ldquo;Oh,
Anne, life is heavenly! There&rsquo;s only just one
long big beautiful moment with me and love and
Tommy. But there are ten million years of
purgatory to get through when he is away from
me, and then I&rsquo;m soul-sick. And I tell myself
I&rsquo;m a sentimental little fool, but it doesn&rsquo;t do one
bit of good. So I wrote to you to come to me till
Patricia, who is a cheerful soul, can join me.
And I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you it was sheer silly
loneliness, so I told you a little white lie,&rdquo; she
ended tragically.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Anne serenely. &ldquo;I knew.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; Muriel was half incredulous.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes; your letter just breathed &lsquo;I want Tommy&rsquo;
all through it. And as a kind of postscript it
added, &lsquo;But you&rsquo;re better than nothing to this
poor moping person, so for Heaven&rsquo;s sake come.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; murmured Muriel pathetically,
&ldquo;thought my letter the height of diplomatic
lying.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; Anne assured her, &ldquo;it
was as transparent as a crystal bowl.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">For a few moments there was a silence. The
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>warm sun was pouring through the open window,
falling across the bed and the slightly tumbled
bedclothes, and glinting on the fair hair of the
woman who lay among the pillows. Strictly
speaking, Muriel Lancing was not beautiful, she
was not even pretty. But there was an odd
charm about her thin little face, her great grey-green
eyes, and her wide mouth. She had a
curious, almost elfin-like appearance. She was
not at all unlike Arthur Rackham&rsquo;s pictures of
Undine as she lay there in some flimsy and diaphanous
garment suggestive of sea-foam. Herself&mdash;her
whole surroundings&mdash;held a suggestion
of elusiveness, a kind of cobwebby grace and
charm. Tommy&mdash;adored of Muriel&mdash;once said
that the house was like an oyster-shell, rough
and ugly on the outside, but inside all soft and
shimmery with a pearl in it. It was his most
brilliantly poetical effusion, and never likely to
be surpassed by him. The only single thing in
the room that struck an incongruous note was
a large&mdash;a very large&mdash;photograph frame on a
table by Muriel&rsquo;s bed. It was a rough wooden
frame, distinctly crooked, and with the glue
showing somewhat in the corners. It held a
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>full-length photograph of an ugly, snub-nosed,
but quite delightful-faced young man with a
wide mouth and an appearance that rightly suggested
red hair and freckles. This was the adored
Tommy, and the frame was his own manufacture.
Next to the man himself they were Muriel&rsquo;s
most treasured possessions.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne looked across at it. She had often seen
it before, but finding it difficult to discover the
most tactful observation to make regarding it,
had refrained from making any. This time,
however, Muriel seemed to notice the direction
of Anne&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Tommy made it himself,&rdquo; she said, stretching
out one white arm, from which a flimsy
covering of lace and gauze-like material fell
away, disclosing its slender roundness. She
moved the frame to an angle better calculated
to show off its superior qualities.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said Anne, politely incredulous,
but understanding. It explained what had
hitherto been a cause for wonderment, namely,
why Muriel should choose to disfigure her room
with such a piece of furniture. Its size almost
calls for the designation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Muriel proudly, &ldquo;himself. I
think,&rdquo; she continued, contemplating the picture
with her head at as one-sided an angle as her
recumbent position would allow, &ldquo;that it is a
beautiful frame.&rdquo; There was the faintest suspicion
of a challenge in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am quite sure,&rdquo; said Anne in a perfectly
grave voice, &ldquo;that you could not possibly have
a frame which you would value more. I know
I couldn&rsquo;t if I happened to be you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel laughed like a contented child. &ldquo;Anne,
you&rsquo;re several kinds of angels, and you have the
heavenliest way of saying the right thing and yet
speaking the truth. Of course I know that its
sides are crooked, and that there are little mountains
of glue in the corners. But you should have
seen Tommy&rsquo;s face when he brought it to me.
The darling was so afraid it was not of quite the
most finished workmanship. Oh, Anne, between
the comicality of his face and the lop-sided expression
of the sticky frame&mdash;the glue wasn&rsquo;t quite
dry&mdash;and the little lump in my own throat for
the darlingness of the thought, I very nearly had
hysterics. But I hid them on Tommy&rsquo;s waistcoat,
and I adore the frame.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Anne, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">Again there was a little pause. Then Muriel
spoke suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What do you think of General Carden? He
monopolized you in the most disgraceful way
last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I liked him,&rdquo; returned Anne, calmly ignoring
the question of monopoly. &ldquo;It is delightfully
refreshing to meet a man so entirely of
the old school of thought and manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s quite a dear,&rdquo; returned Muriel comfortably.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known him since I was in short
frocks and a pigtail. He was a friend of my father&rsquo;s.
They were at Harrow together and afterwards in
the same regiment in India. He thinks me&mdash;well,
just a little flighty, but he doesn&rsquo;t altogether
hate me; and he&rsquo;s quite paternally fond of
Tommy,&rdquo; she ended with a gay little laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; asked Anne, curious, &ldquo;why
does he so dislike Millicent Sheldon? It is quite
obvious he does dislike her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel gave a little start. Then she looked
at Anne, doubtful, hesitating. &ldquo;Oh, my dear
Anne, don&rsquo;t you know? Somehow I fancied
that every one&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; queried Anne idly, but interested.</p>

<p  class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really gossip&mdash;if true things are gossip,&rdquo;
said Muriel half apologetically; &ldquo;still, some one
is sure to tell you sooner or later since you&rsquo;ve
met General Carden.&rdquo; Again she stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But tell me what!&rdquo; demanded Anne. &ldquo;Since
you&rsquo;ve said so much, had you not better give
me the rest? Besides, since you say some one
is sure to tell me, why not let me hear the story
from you? You can sweeten it, add sugar and
cream, if you will, or vinegar and spice, if those
ingredients will flavour it better.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll omit the garnishings;
you shall have the facts plain and simple. Millicent
was once upon a time engaged to General
Carden&rsquo;s son. Then&mdash;for certain reasons&mdash;she
threw him over, and married the highly respectable
and bald-headed Theobald Horatio Sheldon,
whose money&mdash;of which he has a very considerable
quantity&mdash;was made by inventing those little
brush things that are fixed on behind carts and
sweep up the dirt in the roads.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; mused Anne, comprehending. &ldquo;But
of course, as I had never met General Carden
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>before, I naturally did not know that he possessed
a son. He did not, either, happen to
mention him to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But of course not,&rdquo; said Muriel tragically.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly where the reasons and the real
gossip come in. He spent three years in Portland
prison for forgery, or embezzlement, or
something of the kind. He&rsquo;s out now, but he
was in.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Anne seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And,&rdquo; ended Muriel, still more tragically,
&ldquo;General Carden has never seen his son again
nor forgiven Millicent for throwing him over.
It&rsquo;s rather contradictory, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne looked down into the street where a
flower-girl was standing on the pavement with a
basket full of great white lilies. She contemplated
her for a few moments in silence, and
seemingly drew conclusions from the flowers.
She looked round again at Muriel.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I think I understand,&rdquo; she said quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel looked at her curiously. &ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s
quite remarkably intelligent of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Anne calmly. &ldquo;He loves his son
and has never forgotten him. She has forgotten
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>him and probably never loved him. That&rsquo;s
why he can&rsquo;t forgive her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Muriel. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right
that he has not forgotten. He&rsquo;s eating his heart
out for him, or I&rsquo;m much mistaken, and he&rsquo;s too
proud to own it by the quiver of an eyelash. We
women have the easier time. It&rsquo;s our rÃ´le to
keep our arms and hearts open to sinners, and
thank Heaven for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne was again looking at the flowers. She
had said she understood, but in reality it was
only partly. She did understand General Carden,
but Millicent with her serious speeches on nobility
and bigness of character was another matter.
She voiced her perplexity to Muriel.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, but Millicent!&rdquo; said Muriel in a tone
that quite disposed of the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;Millicent has always
talked as if she would help any one re-make his
life, as if it were the one thing she would do,
and&mdash;&rdquo; She broke off.</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel gurgled. &ldquo;Oh, Anne darling, you&rsquo;re
so big-minded and truthful&mdash;in spite of your
occasional woman-of-the-world airs, which are
only a veneer&mdash;that you accept people at their
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>own valuation. The things that people say they
will do are the very things that at a crucial
moment they do not do. I think crucial moments
are a kind of revolution which turns the other
side of the person completely to the fore.&rdquo; And
then her tone changed to one of solemn warning.
&ldquo;You, Anne, doubtless consider yourself a luxury-loving
woman, to whom the bare prospect of
coarse underclothes, cold rooms, ill-cooked food,
and commonplace surroundings would be appalling.
Yet I firmly believe that if the crucial
moment came you would tramp the roads with
your man.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mmm!&rdquo; said Anne. And that rose colour
stole into the ivory of her face, a colour not unnoticed
by the watchful eyes of Muriel. &ldquo;Perhaps,
the roads; but do you think it would carry
me to a suburban house with a glass fanlight over
the front door? It would be the bigger test.
But, and there I think you&rsquo;ve omitted a point,
how about the second moment, the moment when
the crucial moment is passed?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel raised herself on one arm and spoke
firmly. &ldquo;Love&mdash;real love&mdash;is one long crucial
moment. I speak from experience because I
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>love Tommy.&rdquo; She tumbled flat again among
her pillows, and looked across at Anne to challenge
her experience if she dared.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne, being of course an unmarried woman
with no experience of the kind, merely smiled,
a tiny smile which ended in a half sigh.</p>

<h3 class="no-break">LETTERS</h3>

<blockquote><p class="center2"><i>The Unknown Critic to Robin Adair, or the
Lady Anne Garland to Peter the Piper</i></p>

<p class="right2"><span class="smcap">London</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>July 7th</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Robin Adair</span>,&mdash;I have met another
admirer of your book, a delightful old man of
courtly manners of the style of the eighteenth
century. At first he assumed disparagement of it,
or at the best a faint half-hearted kind of praise,
which would, I believe, in any case have roused a
spirit of contradiction in me. With your book
as the subject I waxed eloquent. I took up the
cudgels of defence, and I flatter myself wielded
them with dexterity. When at last the flow of
my discourse ceased&mdash;and I trust I was not too
didactic in my observations&mdash;he confessed calmly
that he had merely assumed disparagement in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>order that he might have the pleasure of hearing me
refute him! It knocked the wind completely out
of my sails. I was left helpless, stranded, entirely
at a loss for a suitable reply. I hope I carried off
the situation with at least a passable degree of
<i>savoir-faire</i>, but I have my doubts.</p>

<p>I so frequently find myself addressing really
witty and brilliant remarks to my bedpost fully
an hour or so after the opportunity of making them
has passed, when the witticism, the brilliance,
might have been delivered in the presence of another,
and have covered me with a dazzling glory.
It is humiliating to contrast what one has said
with what one might have remarked. You
writers have the better time. In silence and
solitude you can consider your epigrams, and then
place them in the mouths of your fictional people
at the psychological moment, and the world is
left to marvel at your brilliance.</p>

<p>But to return to my old courtier. He has a
sad history, which he hides under a mask of urbane
and suave courtliness. He has a son, who&mdash;so
the story runs&mdash;has disgraced their name. The
old man being too proud to overlook the disgrace&mdash;too
proud, perhaps, to stoop and delve for ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>tenuating
circumstances&mdash;has cut the son out of his
life; but fortunately, or unfortunately, he cannot
cut him out of his heart, which is aching, pining,
for the lack of him. Why can he not put pride
in his pocket and ease his heartache? It&rsquo;s a
pitiful little story, and one which has caused my
own heart to ache, though quite possibly I should
have dismissed it without a second thought if I
had not met the old courtier.</p>

<p>The friend with whom I am staying has soothed
the spirit of discontent which was awake in me
when I last wrote. Her method is entirely
unobvious. I think it lies in her own incurably
good spirits, and her optimism, both of which
are infectious. There is an &ldquo;everything is for
the best in this best of all possible worlds&rdquo; air
about her which is exhilarating.</p>

<p>I have, though, been disappointed in another
friend, if I may use the word. Personally I feel
there should be another to use. An acquaintance
signifies one of whom we have but a passing and
superficial knowledge, and a friend some one
much closer&mdash;very close&mdash;the word in its real
sense. Am I drawing too fine a point? Perhaps
one might use the terms I have heard children use,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>&ldquo;friends,&rdquo; and &ldquo;truly friends.&rdquo; So, to use the first
term in application to this woman, I have been
disappointed in a friend. She is not what I
believed her to be, what I believe she wished me to
believe her. It has spoilt, as far as I am concerned
the intimacy between us. I cannot re-adjust
myself towards her, and I feel myself acting the
part of a hypocrite. I have picked up her broken
pieces as best I may, and mended them, but I
am conscious of the cracks. My mending has not
been as neat a job as I could wish. Is it any use
trying to mend? Tell me what you think, O Man!</p>

<p>The worst of it is that before she broke I asked
her to spend a few days with me in August. During
those days I shall be terribly, hideously
conscious of the cracks. I shall find myself staring
at them with a kind of awful fascination. Pray
Heaven she&rsquo;ll not observe it, for if she did I&mdash;in
the rÃ´le of hostess&mdash;would be forever disgraced
in my own eyes.</p>

<p>I do not know why I should write all this to you;
why I should trouble you with what, I am fully
aware, are mere absurdities which any sane and
reasonable person would assuredly dismiss without
a second thought. May I plead in excuse that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>somehow you have taken the position of a
&ldquo;truly friend,&rdquo; one to whom trivialities&mdash;which
after all make up the greater part of one&rsquo;s life&mdash;may
be mentioned without fear of a laugh or a
snub?</p>

<p>I went to a Beethoven concert the other day.
To me he stands head and shoulders above every
other composer, living or dead. Does music
give you the sensation of colour and form? It
does me. That was a purple concert, sphere-shaped.
Mozart&rsquo;s music is sapphire blue and
shaped like a star. Bach&rsquo;s is dark green and
square. Grieg&rsquo;s is pale green with a hint of pink
and a slim oval, Wagner&rsquo;s is crimson and purple
and shaped like a massive crown. I might go on
enumerating, if I did not fear to bore you.</p>

<p>Have you read Conard&rsquo;s life of Beethoven?
Do you know Beethoven&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;Oh
hommes, si vous lisez un jour ceci, pensez que
vous avez Ã©tÃ© injustes pour moi; et que le malheureux
se console, en trouvant un malheureux
comme lui, qui, malgrÃ© tous les obstacles de la
nature, a cependant fait tout ce qui Ã©tait en son
pouvoir, pour Ãªtre admis au rang des artistes et
des hommes d&rsquo;Ã©lites?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>Grand, glorious Beethoven! the struggle over
all infirmity, the victory, and his lonely yet
dramatic death! &ldquo;Il mourut pendant un orage&mdash;une
tempÃªte de neige&mdash;dans un Ã©clat de
tonnerre. Une main Ã©trangÃ¨re lui fermer les
yeux.&rdquo; If I am a hero-worshipper, and it
would seem that I am, Beethoven stands in the
front rank of my heroes. Read his life&mdash;by
Conard&mdash;if you have not already done so. It
is one which every artist, of whatever branch his
art, should know.</p>

<p>How goes it with your Wanderer? Is he reconciled
to his distance from his star? Or have you
let the star fall to his hilltop?</p>

<p>Good-night.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="center2"><i>Robin Adair to the Unknown Critic, or Peter
the Piper to the Lady Anne Garland</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>July 9th.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lady</span>,&mdash;I have re-read your letter more
than once. It is&mdash;dare I say?&mdash;somewhat illogical,
and therein most delightfully feminine.</p>

<p>You suggest that your old courtier should ease
his heartache. Do you not see that in so attempting
he could only bring into his life a thing which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>is in his eyes broken? And, however carefully
he might mend it, would he not be&mdash;as you are&mdash;painfully
and terribly aware of the cracks? Men,
I fancy, choose the wiser way; they throw aside
the broken pieces into a neat little dustbin,
making no attempt to mend. For, after all, is
not the glue which holds the thing together a
certain sophism which is always apparent to the
repairer, and which is, frequently, not very adhesive?
Once broken&mdash;in spite of the glue&mdash;it is
apt to fall to pieces on the slightest handling. No,
the dustbin, in my opinion, is the better solution.
You, as a woman, doubtless will not agree with me.
Women invariably mend, and the majority&mdash;less
critical than you&mdash;fancy they make of the mending
a neat job.</p>

<p>Let me offer you one piece of advice. Do not
let your heart ache for the story you have heard.
It was, no doubt, related to you by another than
your courtier, and was soothed, softened, rendered
pathetic in the telling. You, in your tenderness,
have imagined your courtier as hankering after the
broken pieces of his image in the dustbin. Your
tender imagination removed, the glamour of
pathos round the story would be removed also,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>and you would find heartaches and such-like
non-existent.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the wind is ever so completely
knocked out of your sails&mdash;as you say&mdash;that
you are unable to find some appropriate
reply. That is merely your modesty. I picture
you as talking with charm, with ease, with brilliance.
Witticisms I leave outside the category.
They belong to older men and women, and are
apt to have a poignant edge foreign to my idea
of your words.</p>

<p>I like to think that you count me, as the children
say, a &ldquo;truly friend.&rdquo; Your friendship&mdash;disembodied
though it is&mdash;has brought me refreshment,
happiness. Though for a time my Wanderer had
obsessed me with his mood, the obsession is
passed. It has passed with him also. He does not
desire that the star should fall to him. Its very
charm lies in its altitude. Perhaps one day, when
he has cast off the mantle of his flesh, he will build
himself that ladder of moonbeams, and mount to
it. As it is&mdash;his mood of discontent passed&mdash;he
is worshipping, grateful that it shines in his
otherwise empty firmament. From the little
hilltop&mdash;which he found was but an ant-heap&mdash;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>from
the lanes, from the fields, he looks up to it,
and addresses to it his thoughts, his fancies. He
is once more a cheerful soul, appreciating the earth,
the wind, and the flowers. His love and worship
he keeps for his star.</p>

<p>I have not read Conard&rsquo;s life of Beethoven, nor,
I confess, any writer&rsquo;s life of him. I will make
up for the omission without delay. His music
I know and love. Your little discourse on colour
and shapes in music interests me. I should like
to hear more about them. Unknowingly I believe
I have had the same thoughts, and I agree with
the colours and shapes you assign, with, perhaps,
the exception of Grieg&rsquo;s shape. His colour&mdash;yes;
but I have a fancy that his form is less simple,
more a variety of curves. I think I should give
the oval&mdash;slightly broadened&mdash;to Schumann, and
in its slim form to Heller. Schumann, by the way,
is blue&mdash;darker than Mozart, and, though soft
in colour, less transparent. Heller is pale yellow.
Do you agree?</p>

<p>Write again soon, and tell me everything you will
about yourself.</p>

<p>Good-night.</p>

<blockquote><p class="center2"><i>The Unknown Critic to Robin Adair, or the
Lady Anne Garland to Peter the Piper</i></p>

<p class="right2"><span class="smcap">The Terrace</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>July 16th</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Robin Adair</span>,&mdash;Here I am once more on
my terrace, looking across the garden and the park
land towards a small village&mdash;whose name I will
not disclose&mdash;lying half-hidden among the trees
in the valley. Occasionally, when I am in a
ruminative mood, I wonder at the lives of the
inhabitants thereof&mdash;the routine of them, with
no greater excitement than a visit to the market-town
some eight miles distant. True, there is the
yearly fair at that place, which is an event of the
greatest importance. Every man, woman, and
child, except the extremely old and the extremely
young, flocks to the town on that day. Every
available vehicle is requisitioned and packed with
a mass of humanity to the fullest extent of its
capacities, and those unable to find conveyance
in them, and more stalwart, walk. There are at
the fair, so I am told, booths, coco-nut shies,
merry-go-rounds, and peep-shows of a fat woman
whose age is unknown, but who apparently must
be akin to Methuselah, since she has been regarded,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>it would seem, by the fathers, the grandfathers,
and the great-grandfathers of the present generation.
But with the exception of the fair there is
absolutely nothing to break the monotony of
their lives but the weather and a wedding or a
funeral. It&rsquo;s rather appalling to contemplate,
isn&rsquo;t it? But they seem content and happy, and
that after all is the main thing.</p>

<p>Do you believe in fortune-tellers? I went to
one before I left town. I do not think it was great
credulity in the art that urged me to consult the
sibyl, but merely the fact that the friend with
whom I was staying persuaded me into the consultation.
I had what is termed a &ldquo;full reading.&rdquo;
The palm of my hand was conned, the cards spread
out, and the crystal gazed into. I confess that
the affair was, to a certain degree, uncanny.
Her description of my house&mdash;this one&mdash;was
extraordinary. It might have been before her
as she spoke, and she actually saw me listening to
a concert by the vagabond Piper&mdash;and not only
the concert of which I have told you, but another
concert, one he gave me the night before I went
up to town, and of which I believe no one was
aware but he and I. He came to the terrace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>and played below my window. It was quite
medieval, and entirely delightful. She saw, too,
letters which I was receiving and which were a
source of great pleasure to me, and therein she
was very assuredly right. But&mdash;and I hope
you will not be offended&mdash;after that she began to
mix the Piper and the writer of letters, speaking
of them with confidence as one and the same
person. I did not enlighten her as to her mistake,
as with these sibyls it is better to let them say
what they see without interruption, otherwise
they are apt to try and tell you what they think
you wish to know, what they think you desire
to have said. It was curious. And here I will
make a confession. I myself have occasionally,
and in quite an absurd fashion, confounded the
two in my thoughts. Do not be vexed, Robin
Adair, for you dislike&mdash;or pretend to dislike&mdash;the
Piper. But it seems to me that the sibyl
must have been extraordinary telepathic, and have
somehow read my thoughts, and their occasional
confusion, in a remarkable degree. She told me
a good deal more, no doubt the usual fortune-telling
jargon, which would be, I am sure, of little
interest to you. Certainly it is not worth repe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>tition.
But what I have told you struck me as
distinctly queer.</p>

<p>I am rejoiced to hear that your Wanderer&mdash;and
consequently you&mdash;are once more soothed
and peaceful. And now that he is so, let him
continue to recount his thoughts by the hand of
Robin Adair, that I may shortly have the benefit
of them.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;not to-day&mdash;I will write you all my
fancies on colour, and I have a good many.
Perhaps you are right as to Grieg&rsquo;s form. It is
probably more intricate than the oval. Possibly
it is a design of many curves. As regards Schumann
and Heller, I agree.</p>

<p>I fancy you are wrong about my courtier. He
has, no doubt, acted on your dustbin principle,
but, all the same, I believe he regrets the action.
Of course, I see the justice of your accusation that
my letter was illogical, but I cannot begin an
argument and a defence now. The day is too
warm and lazy for such exertion. The heat-shimmer
is bathing the gardens, and the top of my
silver ink-bottle is almost too hot to touch. The
sun has slanted round, and is frizzling me in a
diabolical fashion. Hitherto I&rsquo;ve been too indolent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>to move, but now, if I don&rsquo;t intend to be
entirely melted, I must get up and pull my chair
into the shade.</p>

<p>Of course fortune-telling is absurd really, at
least as far as regards the future. Though I
grant that this woman&rsquo;s reading of my thoughts
was clever.</p>

<p>Good-bye for the present. The bees are droning
a lullaby, and I believe I shall sleep.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p class="center2"><i>Robin Adair to the Unknown Critic, or Peter
the Piper to the Lady Anne Garland</i></p>

<p class="right"><i>July 18th.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Lady</span>,&mdash;I have no theories as to fortune-tellers
beyond a, no doubt absurd, dislike to them.
I do not care to think of you consulting them.
Forgive me for saying so. I am perfectly well
aware that I have no smallest right to express an
opinion, but&mdash;it will out&mdash;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t,
and long to beg you not to do it again.</p>

<p>When you are in a less melted mood write me
a letter of argument and defence. You will not
be able to explain away your illogical statements,
but I should much enjoy hearing you try to do so.</p>

<p>I must certainly contradict flatly about your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>courtier. I am sure you are wrong. And as I
shall cry &ldquo;Knife&rdquo; every time you cry &ldquo;Scissors,&rdquo;
let us abandon him as a topic of discussion. Write
to me of colours instead.</p>

<p>This is a rude letter, and I know it. But a
little incident has rubbed my mental fur the wrong
way, and I am&mdash;well, cross with myself I believe.
Perhaps it would be wiser not to write at all, but
not to do so would be to discontinue a little ceremony
which I have put in practice since the first
day I heard from you. Will you laugh at me,
I wonder, if I tell you that every evening your
letter arrives I become a host, and toast an invisible
Lady who has condescended to dine with me,
and after dinner we talk together&mdash;through the
medium of pen, ink, and paper. Sometimes I like
to imagine that the medium is less material, and
that my thoughts are carried straight on the wings
of fancy to the Lady&rsquo;s terrace. But if they go, can
she perceive them? Are they not too clumsy, too
material, to find response in her thought-cells?
After all, it is but a fancy, and you may quite well
smile at both it and my dream dinner-party.</p>

<p>To-night I have not been a good host. I
apologize to the Lady. Being the sole guest I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>ever receive, I might have treated her with greater
courtesy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Robin Adair</span>,&mdash;I did not smile&mdash;at any
rate not ironically. If there was a little smile it
was verging close on tears. Are you really so
lonely? Somehow I had fancied that when you
spoke of yourself as a recluse it was a mere figure
of speech. Have you no friends who dine with
you, who visit you&mdash;no material friends?</p>

<p>The little mental picture your letter called up

<h3 class="no-break">A THUNDERSTORM</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;There is a Lady sweet and kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was never face so pleased my mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did but see her passing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I love her till I die,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>sang Peter, in a pleasant tenor voice.</p>

<p class="indent">He was sitting by the window of his cottage,
engaged&mdash;truth will out&mdash;in darning a pair of
green socks. Occasionally he lifted his head from
his work and gazed through the window. It
was intensely still outside; not a leaf, not a blade
of grass was stirring. It was almost overpoweringly
close and sultry. Peter had set both door
and window open in invitation to a non-existent
breeze to enter.</p>

<p class="indent">From the north, where a great bank of ominous
black clouds was piled, came a low, sinister rumble.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; said Peter aloud, looking through
the window. &ldquo;The storm, the tempest, the whole
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>wrath of the furious elements will shortly be
loosed upon us. The clouds are coming up with
extraordinary rapidity, considering there&rsquo;s no
wind at all down here. Up there it must be
blowing half a gale. We&rsquo;ll get rain soon.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He returned to his darning.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Her gesture, motion, and her smiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her wit, her voice, my heart beguiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beguiles my heart, I know not why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I love her till I die,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he sang, sticking his needle carefully in and out
of the heel of the sock.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And the green of the wool doesn&rsquo;t match the
green of the sock one little bit!&rdquo; he said ruefully.
&ldquo;But, after all, no one looks at me; and I certainly
can&rsquo;t look at my own heels&mdash;at least, not without
a certain amount of effort, so <i>n&rsquo;importe</i>, as they
say in France.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Cupid is wingÃ¨d and doth range<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her country, so my love doth change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But change she earth, or change she sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet will I love her till I die.&rdquo;</span></div></div>

<p class="indent">Peter cut the wool with his pocket-knife, and
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>contemplated the sock with his head on one side.
Then he threw it on to the table. There was a
little laugh in his eyes, not caused by the contemplation
of the sock.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said whimsically, &ldquo;that that
fellow&mdash;what was his name?&mdash;Neil Macdonald,
was right after all, and that Chaucer is&mdash;well, an
old fraud. Yet,&rdquo; and a wistful look crept into
his blue eyes, &ldquo;I might have done much better
if I&rsquo;d gone on believing in him. Yet, I don&rsquo;t
know. After all, Peter, my son, isn&rsquo;t the joy worth
a bit of heartache!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He got up from his chair and went towards the
door. He could look over the hedge and up and
down the lane from his position. A couple of big
drops, large as half-crowns, had just fallen on his
spotlessly white doorstep&mdash;Peter was proud of his
doorstep. They were followed by another and
another. There was a flash, a terrific peal, and
then with a sudden hiss came the deluge. Straight
down it fell, as if poured from buckets, and the
lightning played across the sky and the thunder
pealed.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ouf!&rdquo; said Peter, drawing in a huge breath
as the refreshing scent of the grateful earth came
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>to his nostrils. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really quite the very
best smell there is, and worth all your eau-de-colognes,
and your phulnanas, and&mdash;and your
whatever you call &rsquo;em put together. It really
is&mdash;&rdquo; And then he broke off, for down the
lane came running a woman, her head bent, the
rain beating, drenching down upon her. Peter
was at the gate in a moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Come in here!&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p class="indent">She paused, hesitated. Peter saw her face.
His heart jumped, and then started off klip-klopping
at a terrible rate.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo; she began. A blinding flash of lightning,
followed by a terrific peal right overhead,
stopped the words.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Come at once!&rdquo; said Peter imperatively,
sharply almost. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">She ran up the path, he following. In the
shelter of the cottage she turned and faced
him. The colour in her face was not, perhaps,
quite to be accounted for by the rain and her
own haste.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re drenched,&rdquo; said Peter abruptly. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t stay in those wet things a moment longer
than absolutely necessary. With your permission,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>I shall go to your house and order your carriage
to be sent immediately. But first&mdash;&rdquo; He had
put her a chair by the fireplace; he was on his
knees applying a match to the pile of sticks and
fir-cones already laid therein.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; protested Lady Anne, &ldquo;I cannot give
my permission. You will yourself be soaked&mdash;drenched&mdash;if
you venture out in this downpour.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter laughed lightly. &ldquo;It will not be the first
time, nor, I dare to say, the last. Rain has but
little effect on me.&rdquo; He rose from his knees.
The flames were twining and twisting from stick
to stick in long tongues of orange and yellow and
blue. There was a merry crackling, there were
flying sparks.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter crossed to the cupboard. From it he
brought a black bottle and a wineglass.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I have, alas! no brandy to offer you, but port
wine will, I hope, prove as efficacious against a
chill.&rdquo; Without paying the smallest heed to her
protestations he poured her out a glass, which he
held towards her. &ldquo;Drink it,&rdquo; he said, in somewhat
the tone one orders a refractory child to take
a glass of medicine.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne took the glass, meekly, obediently, with
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>the faintest gurgle of laughter. &ldquo;To your health!&rdquo;
she said as she sipped the wine.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter&rsquo;s heart beat hotly, madly. Here was
She, actually She in the flesh, toasting him in his
own room. He poured out another glass.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;To you,&rdquo; he said, and under his breath he
added, &ldquo;My Lady, my Star, my altogether Divinity!&rdquo;
Then he moved firmly to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I cannot allow you to go,&rdquo; said Anne quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Peter, smiling, &ldquo;then I must
forego your permission. In less than half an
hour, in twenty minutes perhaps, your carriage
will be here.&rdquo; And he vanished into the sluice
without.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, as he set off at a half-canter
down the lane, &ldquo;if she does glance round
the room and find it sleeping-apartment as well
as sitting-room, she will, I trust, be less embarrassed.
For Heaven knows whether in some
particulars she may not bow to old Dame
Grundy&rsquo;s decrees. Bless her!&rdquo; And it is to be
conjectured that it was not on Mrs. Grundy&rsquo;s
head that Peter&rsquo;s blessing was invoked.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne, left to solitude, a blazing fire, and a glass
of port, sat for a moment or so deep in thought.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>Who was this man, with his little imperative ways,
his abrupt speech, hiding, she was well aware, a
certain embarrassment? He was well-born, there
was no doubt about that fact. His voice, in
spite of its abruptness, had the pleasant modulation
of breeding. His hands&mdash;she had noticed
his hands&mdash;were long-fingered, flexible, and brown.
They were also well kept. Who was he? But
<i>who</i> was he?</p>

<p class="indent">The fire offering her no solution, she finished
her glass of port, and, kneeling down by the hearth,
let the warmth of the flames play upon her wet
blouse. She unpinned her hat and shook the rain
from it. The drops sizzled as they fell among the
flames and glowing sticks. She put her hat on
the ground beside her and turned towards the
room. She scrutinized it with interest. It was
barely furnished but spotlessly clean. Against
the farther wall she saw a truckle-bed covered
with a blanket of cheerful red and blue stripes;
she saw a cupboard on which were tea-things; a
table; two chairs; and the chair on which she had
been sitting. And that was all.</p>

<p class="indent">Then on the table she saw lying a pair of green
socks; softly green they were, and somewhat
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>faded, and beside them was a card of green&mdash;virulently
green&mdash;mending wool.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;O-oh!&rdquo; said Anne, with a little shudder.
But after a moment she rose from her knees in
order to examine them closer. One sock had a
patch of virulent green in the heel, a neat darn
enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Long practice,&rdquo; said Anne, with a little shake
of the head. In the other was a hole&mdash;quite a
good-sized hole.</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Anne hesitated, then, with a
little smile, took up the card of excruciatingly
green wool and broke off a strand. She threaded
the needle she found stuck into the wool, and
fitted the sock on her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I owe him,&rdquo; said Anne, &ldquo;some small payment
for the shelter.&rdquo; And she laughed, seating herself
again in the armchair. Neatly, deftly, she
drew the wool in and out across the hole, her ears
alert to catch the sound of returning steps, or of
carriage-wheels. The needle moved swiftly and
with dexterity.</p>

<p class="indent">What is one to make of her? Lady Anne
Garland&mdash;the proud, the much-courted, the to
the world always aloof and sometimes disdainful
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>Lady Anne Garland&mdash;sitting in a meagrely furnished
little room by a fire of sticks and fir-cones,
darning the green sock of a vagabond Piper!
And infinitely more incomprehensible is the fact
that he&mdash;this man on whom she had only twice
before set eyes&mdash;was causing her to think of him
in a manner not at all good for the peace of her
own soul; especially as&mdash;and here a distinct confession
must be made&mdash;she was already quite more
than half in love with a man she had never even
seen&mdash;the writer of books and letters, Robin Adair.</p>

<p class="indent">Human nature is a complex and curious thing,
though by those who, having read thus far, hold
the key to the riddle her nature may perhaps be
understood.</p>

<p class="indent">Ten minutes later and a neat darn had replaced
the gaping hole. Finding no implement handy
with which to cut the wool she broke it, then
placed the sock, the wool, and the needle again
upon the table in much the same position they
had previously occupied.</p>

<p class="indent">She got up from her chair and crossed to the
window. The rain was still coming down in
torrents, and the lightning was still frequent, but
the thunder was muttering now at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Once more she looked back into the room.
What a queer little room it was, and how entirely
peaceful! Why did the villagers imagine it to
be haunted? Could anything be more restful,
more reposeful? And how very homely it looked
in spite of its somewhat bare appearance! And
then she stopped in her reflections, for the sound
of wheels had struck upon her ear. A moment
later the carriage came in sight down the lane.
On the box, mackintoshed and stately, were both
coachman and footman.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne laughed. &ldquo;It really was unnecessary
for them both to come,&rdquo; she said to herself. And
then Peter was out of the carriage and up the path
to the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne came forward. &ldquo;I am more than grateful,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;And you must be terribly wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, I shall dry again,&rdquo; he said carelessly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It was very good of you,&rdquo; said Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It was a pleasure,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;to drive in a
carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Anne demurely.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; he continued, and stopped. But
in his heart he added, &ldquo;To do any mortal thing
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>for you, dear Lady!&rdquo; But these speeches had a
way of remaining in his heart without reaching
his lips.</p>

<p class="indent">He unfurled an umbrella which he had purloined
up at the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The rain is not quite so furious now,&rdquo; he said
as he opened it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, my hat!&rdquo; said Anne. She was at the
hearth and back beside him in an instant. But
in the transit she had glanced for a moment at
the green socks on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter, holding the umbrella carefully over her,
conducted her down the path. The footman was
standing by the carriage door. Anne held out
her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A thousand thanks!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter gripped her hand hard. &ldquo;I was delighted
to be of the smallest service,&rdquo; he assured her.</p>

<p class="indent">The footman shut the door; Peter handed him
the umbrella and he mounted with it to the box.
The carriage, which had already turned, drove up
in the direction of the white house on the hill.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter stood looking after it till it was out of
sight, then went back into the cottage. He divested
himself of his extremely wet coat and hung
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>it on the back of a chair by the fire. Not the
armchair; that he gazed at almost reverently,
for had not She sat in it! Then he went to the
table and took up the socks. Arrested suddenly
by something he saw, he examined them both
carefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I am sure,&rdquo; said Peter aloud, &ldquo;that I only
mended one sock, and now both&mdash;&rdquo; He looked
at a darn carefully. &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; said Peter, a
light of illumination in his eyes. It was, however,
almost incredible; he could hardly believe his
senses. He lifted the sock nearer his face. A
faint hint of lavender came to him. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said
he again; &ldquo;the darling, the adorable darling!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter crossed to his cupboard; he placed the
sock carefully inside a sheet of clean manuscript
paper and put it on a shelf.</p>

<p class="indent">Then he sat down in the armchair by the fire,
filled and lit his pipe, and fell into an abstracted
reverie, which lasted fully half an hour.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE EVERLASTING WHY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> here it is necessary to introduce another
character to the reader, one of whom there has
already been a momentary glimpse, but who now
comes forward to play his speaking part. He is
indeed a small character, a young character, and
might, at first appearance, seem insignificant, yet
the part he has to play in Peter&rsquo;s drama is fraught
with much consequence. A very small pebble
dropped into a pool can send out wide circles, so
this small figure dropped into Peter&rsquo;s life was to
play a far-reaching and important part.</p>

<p class="indent">The little figure first made its appearance by
peeping through the hedge in front of Peter&rsquo;s
cottage. It was a boy-child, aged perhaps some
seven summers, and was clad in short blue serge
knickerbockers and a blue jersey.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter himself was sitting by the door piping.
The small figure thought his presence unobserved,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>but Peter&rsquo;s blue eyes were watching him keenly.
He sat very still as he piped, and the music was
calling the child to him.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a friendly, seductive little tune that he
was playing, and Peter saw the child move towards
the gate. He did not look at him now, fearing
by the slightest sign or movement to startle him.
Suddenly Peter felt a light touch on his knee,
gentle as the touch of a small bird&rsquo;s wing. The
child had stolen up the path and was beside
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter&rsquo;s heart leapt with pleasure. It was as
if he had drawn a little wild woodland creature
near him. He still did not move, but he let the
music die away.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; said the small boy, gazing at him
with solemn eyes, &ldquo;and I like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter&rsquo;s eyes wrinkled at the comers in sheer
delight. It was a good many years since a child&rsquo;s
voice had spoken to him, since a child&rsquo;s hand had
been laid upon his knee.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Peter, smiling with pretended laziness,
&ldquo;do you? Well, I fancy the appreciation
is reciprocated. What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Dickie Gordon,&rdquo; responded the small boy.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m staying with my aunt and Lady Anne at
the White House. I like Lady Anne.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter laughed. &ldquo;Your judgment and intuition
are faultless, my son. The Lady Anne is the
divinest woman the good Lord ever created.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then you like her too?&rdquo; queried Dickie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I might go farther than that,&rdquo; said Peter
reflectively; &ldquo;adoration, worship, might be nearer
my sentiments. But how, may I ask, did you
find your way down here?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dickie smiled, an elfin smile of pure wickedness.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I ran away from nurse. She&rsquo;s got the baby
in the perambulator. It&rsquo;s a very young baby,
and perambulators are dull things&mdash;they can&rsquo;t
get over stiles, or go across fields or even the tiniest
kind of streams, not even streams with a plank
across: the wheels are always too wide. And
nurse doesn&rsquo;t understand anything, not why fields
are nicer than roads, and why it&rsquo;s pleasant to
stand still in a wood and listen, and why some
walks are nice ways and some walks dull and
horrid. She thinks everything&rsquo;s just all the same.
And I can&rsquo;t explain things to her, things I know
in my inside. So I just ran away and came to
see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You did, did you?&rdquo; responded Peter. And back
his mind swung to the memory of another small
boy, one of whom the Lady Anne had written
to him, and of another non-understanding grown-up.
Oh, those Olympians who, from their heights
of common sense, cannot stoop to the level of
childhood!&mdash;for stooping they assuredly would
term it, though Peter took another view of the
respective levels. Yet, whatever the levels, the
fact undoubtedly remained the same: their utter
and entire incapacity of seeing eye to eye, of
hearing ear to ear, of feeling heart to heart with
a child. And, mused Peter, it was unquestionable
whose was the greater loss. And then he
roused himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But how about my duty?&rdquo; he demanded.
&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t I to bind you, fetter you, and carry
you back a prisoner to that perambulator, that
very young baby, and that non-comprehending
nurse?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dickie looked at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said comfortably; &ldquo;besides,
I want to talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Peter, again smiling lazily;
&ldquo;well, talk. I shall doubtless make a good audience,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>since the hearing of speech is now something
of a novelty to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Dickie looked at him again. The speech was
not entirely clear, but the encouragement to talk
was.</p>

<p class="indent">With a deep breath he began: &ldquo;Nurse says this
cottage is a bad place, and you&rsquo;re friends with the
Devil. Is he really an unpleasant person? You
don&rsquo;t look&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;d be friends with him if he
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Hmm,&rdquo; said Peter, dubious, his eyes nevertheless
twinkling; &ldquo;I cannot say that I have
honestly a very close acquaintanceship with him&mdash;at
least, I hope not. But I have never fancied
him a pleasant person. He has&rdquo;&mdash;Peter sought
wildly in his mind for the best reason for the
averred unpleasantness&mdash;&ldquo;so little idea of playing
the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; It was Dickie&rsquo;s turn to be dubious
now.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; thought Peter distractedly, &ldquo;I have not
only to make statements, but I have to substantiate
them!&rdquo; Aloud he spoke, firmly, and with
an air of conviction: &ldquo;He does not play the game,
because he pretends to be friendly when he isn&rsquo;t,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>and he tells us things are nice when they aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
This, at all events, was good and orthodox teaching.
Peter patted himself on the back, so to speak.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Like the apple what Adam and Eve ate,&rdquo; said
Dickie solemnly; &ldquo;they thought it was going to
taste so nice, and make them very wise, but it
was a sour apple, and they had to go away out of
the garden &rsquo;cause they ate it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said Peter, much relieved that
Dickie should be taking the initiative as chronicler
of biblical events, feeling, be it stated, somewhat
hazy on these subjects himself.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause. Then, with a deep sigh,
Dickie spoke again.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I wish I knew things.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What things?&rdquo; asked Peter, amused.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Lots of things,&rdquo; said Dickie. There was a
world of unconscious yearning in the child&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;I want to know lots of things. What made God
think the world? Did He think me from the
beginning, &rsquo;cause He knew everything? Why
did He wait till now to make me? I&rsquo;d so lots
sooner have been a Viking. Why doesn&rsquo;t He let
us choose what we are to be? Why are some days
nice and other days horrid, though everything
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>looks just &rsquo;xactly the same and just as sunny?
Why don&rsquo;t I know the whys of things?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Peter with a long-drawn breath,
and a silence fell, while suddenly, and perhaps
for almost the first time in his life, Peter faced
the great eternal Question&mdash;the Everlasting Why
of the Universe. And because he had no answer
to give, because he had not as yet the faintest
inkling of the answer, he was silent, though, all unconsciously,
the child had put before him the problem
his soul was inarticulately striving to solve.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Dickie again, gazing at him.
And then Peter replied.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You had better ask Lady Anne,&rdquo; he responded,
basely shifting the responsibility. Yet though he
half acknowledged the baseness, he knew confidently
that she must be better able to deal with
the question than he, for surely she, enshrined
where she was in his thoughts, would have some
knowledge, some answer to give, something to
which he might listen with as great confidence
as the child beside him would listen.</p>

<p class="indent">And then suddenly down the lane came a shrill
voice, causing Dickie to start and Peter to look
up quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Master Dickie, Master <i>Dickie</i>!&rdquo; The tones
were unquestionably somewhat strident.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nurse,&rdquo; whispered Dickie.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;So I concluded,&rdquo; said Peter dryly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
to be done?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose I must go,&rdquo; announced Dickie ruefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Master <i>Dickie</i>!&rdquo; The voice was close now,
and the next moment a heated woman in nurse&rsquo;s
garb and wheeling a perambulator came into view.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter got up and went down to the gate, holding
Dickie&rsquo;s small brown hand close in his big one.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Peter courteously, &ldquo;that you
are looking for Master Dickie; here he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The woman paused, flabbergasted. &ldquo;With
you!&rdquo; she ejaculated.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;With me,&rdquo; said Peter, smiling. &ldquo;And after
all he has heard about me,&rdquo; he continued seriously,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a wonder that he ventured near this cottage.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse looked at Peter. There was something
in his manner that checked the outburst of
indignation that was perilously near the surface.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been that worried!&rdquo; she said, and she
stopped to wipe her face with a large white
handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter appreciated her concern. It is unquestionably
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>trying to lose a small boy entrusted to
your care, especially on an exceedingly warm
summer day, and have no notion what has become
of him. Peter felt a bit of a culprit.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry you&rsquo;ve been bothered,&rdquo; he
said contritely. &ldquo;He&mdash;&rdquo; and Peter paused; he
could not give Dickie away.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I came to see him,&rdquo; announced Dickie calmly,
&ldquo;because I wanted to find out what he was like.
Now if you want me I&rsquo;ll come home. Good-bye,
Mr. Piper.&rdquo; He held out his hand, which Peter
shook gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bad boy,&rdquo; said the nurse, virtuous
indignation in her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Dickie scorned a reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He really hasn&rsquo;t come to any harm,&rdquo; said
Peter apologetically.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; said the nurse with majestic
significance, divided between her previous
conception of Peter and the now very obvious
fact that he was of gentle birth; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s as may be.
But his aunt won&rsquo;t care to hear of his goings-on,
nor my Lady either, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Lady Anne will understand,&rdquo; protested Dickie,
voicing Peter&rsquo;s own opinion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;She may and she mayn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; was the tart reply.
&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ll please to come home; we&rsquo;re half an
hour late as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I said I was ready before,&rdquo; remarked Dickie
calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse jerked the perambulator round in a
manner that caused the very young baby within
to open its eyes in a kind of mild protest.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come and see you again,&rdquo; said Dickie
confidently to Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">The nurse pulled him by the arm. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
do nothing of the kind, Master Dickie.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Dickie, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know. I
shall ask Lady Anne.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And then the three disappeared down the lane.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The Lady Anne,&rdquo; remarked Peter to himself,
&ldquo;is evidently a divinity to another and much
smaller person than I. I don&rsquo;t exactly love that
nurse,&rdquo; he continued reflectively, &ldquo;but I fancy
she has her hands full.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And whistling airily, Peter passed up the little
path to the cottage.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</p>

<h3 class="no-break">PIPER AND AUTHOR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> at the White House Lady Anne Garland
was entertaining Millicent Sheldon. The entertainment
to Lady Anne proved somewhat weighty.
The carefully mended Millicent was a different
person from the one she had previously known.
Her whole aspect was altered in Anne&rsquo;s eyes. She
no longer saw her, as Millicent no doubt saw
herself, a calm gracious Madonna, stretching out
healing hands to a weary humanity. To Anne
she was simply a very ordinary woman who had
failed the man she had once loved&mdash;or professed
to love&mdash;in his need.</p>

<p class="indent">And Anne suddenly realized that for all Millicent&rsquo;s
grand and noble statements she had no use
for failures. Let a man have his foot firmly
planted on the ladder of success, albeit on the
lowest rung, Millicent spoke of him with gracious
condescension, held out the hand of friendship to
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>him. Those who had fallen from the ladder, or
who were struggling towards it with little chance of
reaching it, were not in her eyes worth a moment&rsquo;s
consideration. Truly the cracks were horribly,
terribly conspicuous, and Anne had much ado
to prevent Millicent from recognizing that she
perceived them. She looked forward to the day of
Millicent&rsquo;s departure with a guilty hopefulness, a
secret longing which she felt was almost indecent
in a hostess. And then something happened to
delay that day.</p>

<p class="indent">Dickie, the solemn-eyed Dickie, fell ill. It
was one of those sudden swift illnesses of childhood
that grip the hearts of parents with a terrible
fear, and Anne and Millicent, who loved the small
boy as if he were their own, watched the little
fever-stricken body with grave anxiety, and
dreaded to think what news the next mail to
India might not carry.</p>

<p class="indent">The villagers came daily to inquire. Voices
were hushed when the child&rsquo;s name was mentioned.
Peter alone, to whom no one ever spoke,
did not know of the illness. He only wondered
why Dickie, who had escaped his vigilant nurse
more than once, did not come to the cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p class="indent">And then one day, when the fever was running
high, Dickie began a plaint, a piteous little moaning
for the Piper. Backwards and forwards on
the pillow tossed the small fevered head; the dry
lips called ceaselessly to the Piper to come and
pipe to him. In some vague way Dickie had confounded
him with the Pied Piper of Hamelin, and
wanted Peter to take him through the mountain
and show him sparrows brighter than peacocks
and horses with eagles&rsquo; wings. Peter had told
Dickie many a tale of fancy during his visit to
the cottage.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Who is it he wants?&rdquo; asked the doctor sharply,
watching the child. &ldquo;Can no one fetch him?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne, who was near the bed, stood up.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I will write a note and
send&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor, a little man with a crusty manner
and a heart as tender as a woman&rsquo;s, interrupted
her testily.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you go yourself?&rdquo; he snapped. &ldquo;I
know what servants are when they&rsquo;re sent on
messages. The child is&mdash;I&rsquo;m anxious, and as
cross as an old bear,&rdquo; he concluded.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne was already at the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not be long,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Miss Haldane
will be here if you need her. I&rsquo;ll send her to you.
Nurse is with the baby and Mrs. Sheldon is lying
down. She was up most of last night.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">A few moments later Anne was walking down
the drive. It was a grey afternoon, lapped in soft
clouds, and with a little sad wind in the trees
suggestive of autumn, though it was only August.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne felt a sensation of depression, a faint
foreboding as of impending ill. She told herself
that it was merely fatigue. Dickie would get
well&mdash;she knew he would get well. And yet she
did not really think that anxiety regarding Dickie
was causing this depression. It was something
more remote, something intangible and vague.</p>

<p class="indent">She determined not to think about it&mdash;to throw
aside the slight uneasiness. Yet again and again
it crept over her in insidious little waves, despite
all her efforts to the contrary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">Peter was busy writing when the knock came
on his door. Now, whether it was telepathy or
clairvoyance is not known, but his heart jumped
at the knock, and he got up quickly, opening wide
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What is wrong?&rdquo; he queried anxiously as
he saw Anne&rsquo;s face. He almost forgot to be
surprised at her presence there.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dickie,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s ill, very ill.
The child has got some queer ideas into his head.
He has mixed you up in an odd way with the Pied
Piper of Hamelin. He has been talking about
you a great deal&mdash;half in delirium, you understand.
He wants you to pipe to him.&rdquo; She stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; ejaculated Peter, his voice full of sympathy.
&ldquo;The pathetic little mite! I&rsquo;ll come at
once.&rdquo; And then he, too, stopped, hesitated.
&ldquo;If you will go on,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; asked Anne, &ldquo;come back with
me now at once? I fancy&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;that
the doctor thinks every minute is of
importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter flushed. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
now. It was only&mdash;&rdquo; Again he stopped, and
Anne waited, wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Peter desperately, &ldquo;that I thought
perhaps you would rather not walk with me.
I&mdash;the villagers, you know, look upon me with
disfavour.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne raised her chin. There was a little regal
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>air in the gesture. &ldquo;But really,&rdquo; she assured him,
&ldquo;I am not accustomed to consider the opinion
of the villagers.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, you idiot,&rdquo; groaned Peter inwardly,
&ldquo;you idiot, you double-dyed dolt! Now you&rsquo;ve
offended her, though I protest your intentions
were good.&rdquo; Aloud he said meekly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come
with you at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned and picked up his hat from a chair.
As the long peacock feather caught his eye, again
he groaned inwardly. He was for flinging the
hat aside, but Lady Anne was watching him. He
put it on his head desperately, and came out on
to the path beside her, feeling for all the world a
mountebank, a popinjay, a fool. Why, oh why!
had he maliciously defied the Fates? Why, oh
why! had this peacock feather lain in his path once
long ago? And still further, why had he been
idiot enough to pick it up and wear it merely in a
spirit of contradiction, because once upon a time
a woman had announced her belief in a superstition
regarding peacock feathers.</p>

<p class="indent">He attempted to appear unconcerned, at his
ease, but he was aware that the attempt was a
poor one. Nor did the amazed glances of the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>villagers, as they crossed the green, tend to reassure
him. Yet here was Lady Anne walking
calmly, quietly, entirely at her ease, entirely
dignified. Why was he ass enough to care for
the glances of these yokels! Yet he knew it was
not for himself that he cared, but for his Lady,
his divinity, who had deigned herself to visit his
cottage, to ask him with her own lips to perform
a service for her. He longed for a flow of words
to come to him, yet none but the most banal
remark presented itself to his mind, therefore he
walked beside her in silence.</p>

<p class="indent">At the entrance to the drive Peter suddenly
shivered, why, he did not know, for the day, though
grey, was hot. It was as if some slight indefinable
feeling of apprehension had struck him.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne glanced at him. &ldquo;Cold?&rdquo; she queried,
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded Peter, smiling in response.
&ldquo;I fancy it was&mdash;according to the old adage&mdash;a
goose walking over my grave.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Anne. And the slight feeling of
uneasiness, which had temporarily departed,
returned.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Which, so say the superstitious folk,&rdquo; continued
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>Peter lightly, &ldquo;denotes misfortune to the
owner of the grave. Personally&mdash;&rdquo; He broke
off with a slight shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You are not a believer in omens and superstitions,&rdquo;
suggested Anne in conclusion. &ldquo;So I
might suppose. Your&mdash;your hat decoration is
generally regarded as provocative of ill-luck,&rdquo;
she smiled.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter flushed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fool thing to wear,&rdquo; he
said lamely, &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said Anne demurely, &ldquo;it
fits in with your rÃ´le. I believe it was the
rumour of the peacock feather that first gave me
the courage to ask you to play to me. It sounded
fantastic, unusual. I dared to think that you
might respond to an unusual invitation. The
feather, I repeat, gave me courage.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Peter gallantly, &ldquo;I wear it with
a good will as an omen of fortune&rsquo;s favours. You
did not, however, ask me a second time.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne drew a quick breath. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she responded.
&ldquo;Yet&mdash;you came.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter quietly, &ldquo;I came.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne might have spoken again, but they
were at the door by now, and they passed
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>into the hall together and up the wide shallow
stairs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">The sick-room was in half light, for the curtains
were partly drawn. The doctor was sitting by
the bed, his eyes watching, grave. Miss Haldane
was at a little distance. They both looked up as
the two entered.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne crossed to the bedside, Peter following.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Dickie,&rdquo; said Anne, softly and distinctly, &ldquo;I
have brought the Piper to you.&rdquo; She sat down
and took one of the small hot hands in hers.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter came to the foot of the bed. He drew
his pipe from his pocket. As the first sweet
notes of the pipe filled the room Dickie lay still.
It was the friendly, seductive little tune Peter
had first played to the child. No one stirred
and the magic piping breathed through the air.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;More,&rdquo; said Dickie, as Peter stopped. And
the request was quiet, conscious.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter came a little nearer. &ldquo;This, Dickie, is
the sleepy song the Pied Piper played the children
when he carried them away to the Wonderful
Land. So shut your eyes and listen, and you will
sleep and dream of running streams, and flowers,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>and of cool green grass, and beautiful birds, and
horses with eagles&rsquo; wings, that will carry you away
gently on their backs to the place where children
get well.&rdquo; Peter&rsquo;s voice dropped to a murmur.</p>

<p class="indent">And then once more came the music, a low
crooning lullaby, full of adorable restful tenderness.
Dickie&rsquo;s eyes closed drowsily. The music
crooned on, rocking softly, soothingly. Then
Dickie gave a little gentle sigh, his fingers relaxed
their hold on Anne&rsquo;s, his small hand fell open on
the counterpane, and Dickie slept.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; breathed the old doctor. And
he took off his spectacles and wiped them.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked at Anne. She nodded, and rose
from her chair. They stole softly from the room
together. They passed down the corridor. Then
Anne turned and spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say anything but &lsquo;Thank you.&rsquo;&rdquo; She
smiled, a little wavering smile, and her eyes were
misty.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Peter with a huge sigh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad.
He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s such a jolly little chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And then he looked up, for a woman was coming
towards them.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is Mrs. Sheldon, Dickie&rsquo;s aunt,&rdquo; said Anne,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>explanatory. &ldquo;She&mdash;&rdquo; And she broke off,
amazed at the sudden rigidity of Peter&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Millicent as she saw the two. And
she stopped dead.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; queried Anne, astonished. &ldquo;Do
you two know each other?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I once had the pleasure of Mr. Carden&rsquo;s
acquaintance,&rdquo; said Millicent stiffly, &ldquo;but
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mr. Carden!&rdquo; ejaculated Anne. And a
light dawned upon her, a light of painful
significance.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I was not aware he was in the house,&rdquo; said
Millicent coldly. &ldquo;I was not aware that you
knew him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Peter spoke. &ldquo;As Peter Carden Lady
Anne does not know me,&rdquo; he said steadily, though
his face was white. &ldquo;She knows me only as
Peter the vagabond Piper.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;An alias,&rdquo; said Millicent scornfully. &ldquo;One,
no doubt, of several.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne was waiting, silent. Peter had a sudden
thought that she was waiting for him to speak, to
deny the accusation if he could. He felt utterly
and entirely weary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; he said bitterly; &ldquo;only one other&mdash;Robin
Adair.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Anne, shrinking as if the name had
been a blow.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It really does not signify what you choose to
call yourself,&rdquo; said Millicent. &ldquo;But I do not
care that my friends should be deceived.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter drew in his breath sharply. He looked
straight at her, and in her eyes he could read the
true cause for her anger. &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he
said quietly. &ldquo;And I have deceived her.&rdquo; He
turned to Anne. Her head was erect, her face
white, motionless. Indignation, anger, contempt,
he saw all three in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">He turned without a word and passed down the
stairs, across the hall, and through the hall door,
which he closed softly behind him as he went.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</p>

<h3 class="no-break">FAREWELL</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night was far spent. For hours Peter had
sat by his table with writing materials before him,
and at length his letter was written, ended.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is the last time I shall write to you, but I
ask you to condone my conduct&mdash;at least, sufficiently
to read what I have written. I know I
have no excuse to make. To say that my deception
arose from the knowledge that if you once
knew Peter the Piper and Robin Adair as one and
the same I should lose your letters is of course
none. I deceived you deliberately, and broke
the compact that our identities should remain
unknown to each other. Though I did not first
break it, nor was it broken of my will. Being
broken by fate, however, I should have told you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And by now you will have realized that you
extended the hand of friendship to one who had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>entirely forfeited the right to it. Is it, perhaps,
any compensation to you to know that your letters,
your kindness, have at least been received with
humble gratitude, with the most intense and overwhelming
pleasure by one however unworthy to
receive them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall leave this cottage at daylight. My
presence here longer would, I know, be distasteful
to you. I have no right to ask your forgiveness,
yet if one day you could extend it to me, and think
less hardly of me, I should be glad. The one
thing I can do, and believe you would wish me to
do, is to destroy your letters. I cannot destroy
the memory of them&mdash;that is impossible, and I
dare to hope that in your generosity you will not
grudge it to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently I shall try to write again, and if ever
fate should throw my work in your path, and you
deign to read it, then know that whatever in it
is of worth, whatever is in the smallest degree
of good, has been inspired by the thought of
you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For all your blessed kindness, for the fact that
you are you and are in the world, I shall throughout
my life be grateful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps one day I may get the chance to
atone.</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Peter Carden.</span>&rdquo;<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p class="indent">The letter written, Peter got up from his chair
and crossed to the fireplace. In a few moments
a flame sprang up, and some bluish papers twisted
and shrivelled in its heat. Presently nothing was
left but a small heap of grey ashes.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter sat very still. There was a lump in his
throat, and he swallowed hard once or twice, but
his eyes were dry. A bird chirped in the bushes
outside the cottage; it was answered by another
and another. The air became full of a chorus of
twitterings and chirpings.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter roused himself. He picked up his hat
and a bundle from the table and went to the cottage
door. In the east the sky was flushing to
rose and lavender. Peter went down the path.
He opened the little gate. A moment later it
had swung to behind him, and he was walking
down the dusty road.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</p>

<h3 class="no-break">A WOUNDED SKYLARK</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Haldane</span> was worried, perturbed. Her
usually cheerful old face was wrinkled into lines
of perplexity, her eyes were anxious.</p>

<p class="indent">Something was wrong at the White House.
Dickie had slept peacefully throughout the night,
and with the extraordinary recuperation of children,
had demanded bread and milk on awaking.
It was perfectly natural to suppose that an air of
jubilation should prevail. Yet Lady Anne was
pale, silent, aloof; Millicent Sheldon slightly cold
and frigid. What in the name of wonder did it
signify? Vaguely Miss Haldane connected the extraordinary
atmosphere with the Piper. It was
true that he had been accountable, under Providence,
for Dickie&rsquo;s marvellous recovery, yet Miss
Haldane distinctly regarded him as a bird of ill-omen,
and in her heart bitterly regretted that
necessity had called him to the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Throughout the day she fidgeted and fluttered
interiorly, keeping sharp and anxious watch on
Anne&rsquo;s pale and almost stern face, without, however,
in the least appearing to do so. At tea-time
she found herself alone in the drawing-room
with Millicent, Anne being in Dickie&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Miss Haldane could contain her anxiety
no longer. She disliked Millicent Sheldon, but
it was a case of any port in a storm. Having
poured out tea and handed Millicent a cup, she
prefaced her first remark by a slight and nervous
cough.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Anne looks very pale,&rdquo; she said tentatively.
&ldquo;I hoped to see her looking better now our anxiety
is practically at an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Millicent, taking a sip of tea.</p>

<p class="indent">This was unsatisfactory. Miss Haldane returned
to the charge more openly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that nothing has worried
her?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Millicent put down her teacup. &ldquo;It is distinctly
unfortunate,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that that man
who called himself Peter the Piper should have
come into this neighbourhood.&rdquo; She made the
remark with a calm majesty of manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; queried Miss Haldane, pricking up her
ears and looking for all the world like a terrier on
the scent of a rat; &ldquo;do you know anything about
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Only that he has spent three years in prison
for forgery,&rdquo; said Millicent gravely. &ldquo;Anne has
got unaccountably familiar with him in some way,
and is naturally vexed to find her friendship misplaced.&rdquo;
She puckered her smooth white brow
with an air of grave, gracious anxiety, but there
was a hard expression in her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane ruffled like a small angry bird,
the terrier expression forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Lady Anne,&rdquo; she said with dignity, &ldquo;is certainly
not familiar with him. You must have
been misinformed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; Millicent lifted her eyebrows coolly.
&ldquo;From Anne&rsquo;s own showing yesterday, she knew
considerably more about him than probably you
or I had the smallest idea of. She has not seen
fit to confide in me, but it was entirely apparent.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane sat very upright. &ldquo;If Anne did
know more of him than we imagine,&rdquo; she remarked
firmly, &ldquo;it shows that he was a more desirable
person to know than I had supposed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Millicent controlled her temper admirably.
Of course, it was entirely absurd, but the old
thing was, unquestionably, trying to snub her.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;A man who has been in prison!&rdquo; she remarked,
with an air of quiet finality and an exasperating
little laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane&rsquo;s usually dim old eyes blazed.
&ldquo;Under God we owe Dickie&rsquo;s recovery to him,&rdquo;
she said with quiet dignity. &ldquo;Might not that
make us a little charitable towards him?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And Millicent, for her outward imperturbability
of manner, was annoyedly conscious that Miss
Haldane had scored.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Anne walked in.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Am I interrupting confidences?&rdquo; she asked,
with an attempt at her usual lightness of manner.
&ldquo;Dickie is a fraud; he is demanding bread and
jam, or at least toast and honey. I consider he
has basely deceived us all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And then she saw that the atmosphere was really
strained, tense. She pretended blindness, however,
and, sitting down, asked for some tea. While
drinking it she made a few airy remarks, to which
Miss Haldane responded absent-mindedly, and
Millicent with a pained and almost holy silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Then Millicent got up. &ldquo;I am going to see
Dickie,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">As the door closed behind her, Miss Haldane
gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;How I dislike that woman!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I saw she had ruffled you,&rdquo; said Anne
soothingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;She was impertinent,&rdquo; remarked Miss Haldane
with dignity.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Millicent! Impertinent!&rdquo; Anne&rsquo;s eyes were
big with amazement. &ldquo;My dear Matty!&rdquo; She
might be many things, but impertinent seemed
the last word to connect with the large statuesque
Millicent.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Impertinent,&rdquo; said Miss Haldane firmly. &ldquo;It
is only her size that makes it not usually apparent.
If she were a small woman, it would be obvious
to the meanest intelligence. And she is distinctly
ungrateful. Whatever that man has done, whatever
he is, we owe him a debt of gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Anne, her eyes clouding; &ldquo;she was
talking about him?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes. My dear, have you considered that
even if he did wrong in the past he may have
repented? And he did help Dickie.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anne slowly; &ldquo;he helped Dickie.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Even if,&rdquo; continued Miss Haldane earnestly,
&ldquo;he has once been in prison, he cannot be altogether
bad at heart, or a child&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped.
To her own surprise, the contradictory old thing
was defending the Piper.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, prison!&rdquo; said Anne vaguely.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes; didn&rsquo;t you know? Was not that why
you were vexed&mdash;angry?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne gave an odd little laugh. &ldquo;No, Matty,
dear. To be candid, it was not that at all. Somehow&mdash;it&rsquo;s
queer, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;I never thought of
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then why&mdash;?&rdquo; began Miss Haldane, perplexed,
vague.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a complicated situation,&rdquo; said Anne
dryly; &ldquo;but&mdash;well, every atom of pride I ever
possessed has been dragged in the mud, humbled,
abased. Now you have the truth; and for Heaven&rsquo;s
sake don&rsquo;t ask me any more!&rdquo; Again the hard
look crept into her face. She got up and moved
to the window.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Haldane watched her. Had there been
any truth in Millicent&rsquo;s words? Had she seen
more of this man than Miss Haldane had supposed?
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>Clandestine meetings, secret letters, fluttered
rapidly before Miss Haldane&rsquo;s mind. Then
she looked at Anne again. It was impossible.
Whatever had happened, it was certain that
it was nothing of which Anne need really be
ashamed.</p>

<p class="indent">And Anne, silent at the window, had bitterness
in her heart; she felt her pride, as she had said,
humbled, dragged in the dust. This man to whom
she had written had amused himself at her expense.
As one person he had received her intimate
letters, as another he had been the recipient
of gracious favours on which he had doubtless
put a totally wrong construction. Posing as two
men, yet in reality one, he could compare the
favours she had accorded both. The rose, the
green sock&mdash;her face burnt at the thought of them.
The one man, Robin Adair, smiling at her gracious
letters, and smiling still more at her gracious
treatment of the vagabond Piper.</p>

<p class="indent">It was monstrous, preposterous! How he must
have laughed in his sleeve when she told him of
her inclination to confound the two men. Anger
and indignation were in Anne&rsquo;s heart at the
thought, yet deeper still was an odd little ache,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>and the fact that it existed, and she was conscious
of it, curiously enough increased her indignation
against Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened softly, and the footman entered
with a letter on a tray. He crossed to the
window where Anne was standing. As she saw
the letter lying there, a hot flush mounted in her
face. She took it, holding it irresolutely in her
hand. When the door had closed again, she broke
the seal.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence. At last Miss Haldane
looked round. Anne&rsquo;s face was quivering.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Miss Haldane, her voice
full of perplexed anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Anne, with a half sob, &ldquo;that I
have torn the little young wings from a skylark.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="no-break">CANDLES AND MASSES</h3>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> at the beginning of the last chapter Miss
Haldane was perturbed, worried, perplexed, so,
rather more than two months later, Muriel Lancing
was perturbed, worried, perplexed, also; and
for the same cause, namely, the strange demeanour
of the Lady Anne Garland, who had returned to
town at the beginning of November.</p>

<p class="indent">She was changed, she was totally different, so
sighed Muriel, reflective, meditative. Where was
her former charm? her former sweet kindliness?
her faith, her trust, her buoyancy&mdash;in short, her
everything that went to make up the Anne Muriel
knew and loved? An obsession seemed to have
come upon her. She was cynical, hard, the speaker
of little bitter phrases, deliberately calculated to
wound and hurt. She was not, as Muriel reflected,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>Anne at all, but a mask, a shell of a woman, in
which deep down the real Anne was imprisoned,
buried.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If only she would speak,&rdquo; sighed Muriel to
herself. &ldquo;If only the mask could be removed
for a moment the real Anne would be liberated.
Confession, so says dear old Father O&rsquo;Sullivan,
is good for the soul. It would be incalculably
good for Anne&rsquo;s. But she won&rsquo;t make one. And
short of asking her straight out to do so, which
would inevitably fix the mask on tighter still, I
can do nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">But, all the same, Muriel went off to the Oratory
and set up a candle to St. Joseph, telling him
pretty lucidly the whole state of affairs and requesting
him to do something.</p>

<p class="indent">Now whether it was the intervention of St.
Joseph, or whether it was that the real imprisoned
Anne could bear her solitary confinement no
longer, must be a matter for pure conjecture: but
on the next occasion that Muriel visited Anne&rsquo;s
house in Cheyne Walk she was distinctly conscious
that though the mask was on there was a tiny
crack in it, and through the crack the real Anne
was looking with a kind of dumb pleading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p class="indent">In a twinkling Muriel&rsquo;s finger was towards it,
in, of course, the most insidious and hidden way
imaginable. It is useless to attempt to describe
her methods; they were purely feminine, entirely
delicate. At length the shell, the mask, fell
asunder, and the real Anne, being liberated,
spoke. It was an enormous relief to her, and
from the very beginning up to Millicent&rsquo;s disclosure
she confided the whole story to Muriel,
who watched her with her greeny-grey eyes full
of sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, but,&rdquo; cried Muriel as she stopped, &ldquo;I
quite understand your anger. Of course, it&rsquo;s
very difficult to put into exact words why you
are angry, the whole situation is so extraordinarily
complicated. But,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;any woman
with the smallest modicum of sense must see
why. And the fact that Millicent was the person
there at the time can&rsquo;t have made things a
bit nicer.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Anne quietly. &ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t
finished yet. He wrote to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; queried Muriel.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&mdash;his letter swept away all my anger. I&mdash;I
understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Muriel nodded, &ldquo;there is his
point of view.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I saw it,&rdquo; said Anne. &ldquo;I realized&mdash;or thought
I realized&mdash;the utter loneliness that made him
act as he had done. I&mdash;I wrote to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; queried Muriel again, and very gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I said&mdash;oh, I said a good deal,&rdquo; confessed
Anne. &ldquo;And&mdash;and he has never replied. Oh,
don&rsquo;t you see it&rsquo;s that that hurts? I said things
I would never have said if I hadn&rsquo;t believed he
was longing for me to say them, if I hadn&rsquo;t&rdquo;&mdash;Anne&rsquo;s
face was crimson&mdash;&ldquo;wanted to say them.
I was so sure I&rsquo;d hear from him again. And&mdash;and
there was only a cruel silence. I&rsquo;d give anything
never to have written that letter.&rdquo; Shamed,
broken, she looked piteously at Muriel. Anne
was proud, and she was young. She did not yet
know that there is no shame in giving love, offering
it purely, finely, as she had done. Is not God
Himself daily making the offering, an offering
from which too many of us turn away?</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But, darling Anne,&rdquo; cried Muriel, &ldquo;perhaps&mdash;surely
he could not have received it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Anne shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d like to
believe,&rdquo; she said with a little bitter laugh, &ldquo;what
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>we&rsquo;d both like to believe. But it&rsquo;s no good. I
sent it to his publishers, the same address as that
to which I&rsquo;d sent the others. Oh, no! that kind
of letters don&rsquo;t miscarry. I have misunderstood
all through.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; said Muriel softly.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a long silence, broken only by an
occasional little sputtering of the coal in the fire,
and the rumble of wheels and clack of horses&rsquo;
hoofs without. And in the silence Muriel was
giving very deep thanks to St. Joseph that Anne&mdash;her
beloved Anne&mdash;was once more restored to her.
Also she was cogitating in her own mind still
further benefits to be asked of him.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Anne broke the silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Muriel, I&rsquo;d rather you should forget&mdash;that
we should never speak again&mdash;about what I&rsquo;ve
told you this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel took up an illustrated paper from a side
table.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Hats,&rdquo; she announced sententiously, &ldquo;will be
worn small this winter, and skirts mercifully not
quite so tight. Have you noticed Mrs. Clinton?
She&rsquo;s positively indecent. I blush scarlet if I&rsquo;m
with a man when I meet her.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Anne laughed, though there were tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Muriel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the silliest and
dearest little elf in Christendom.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel made more than one further journey
to the Oratory to explain matters to St. Joseph,
on each occasion presenting that delightful saint
with a candle. The first time&mdash;subsequent to
Anne&rsquo;s confession&mdash;that she went to the Oratory
she gave him two, one being for thanksgiving.</p>

<p class="indent">Also she invited Father O&rsquo;Sullivan to tea on an
occasion when Tommy, by Muriel&rsquo;s suggestion,
had taken Anne to skate at Prince&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="indent">Father O&rsquo;Sullivan was a short, stoutish man,
with grizzled hair, small twinkling eyes, and a
mouth that had the kindliest twist of a smile
imaginable. To know Father O&rsquo;Sullivan for an
hour was to love him. To know him for longer
was to love him better. Muriel had known him
from her babyhood.</p>

<p class="indent">This afternoon, having invited him to tea, she
plied him with cakes and quince sandwiches,
which latter his soul adored, and talked in a gay
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>and inconsequent fashion of airy nothings, to
which Father O&rsquo;Sullivan responded after the
manner of Irishmen, be they priests or laymen.</p>

<p class="indent">But on the conclusion of the meal she dropped
into a pensive mood, and sat with her elbow on
the arm of her chair, and her pointed chin resting
in her cupped hand, gazing into space with great
dreamy eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">And then all at once she roused herself and
looked across at Father O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said seriously, &ldquo;I want you to
say a Mass for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You do, do you?&rdquo; said Father O&rsquo;Sullivan,
stroking his chin. &ldquo;And with what intention?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Muriel, reflective, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not quite
easy to explain. I think I&rsquo;d better tell you the
story.&rdquo; And she launched forth, omitting names
at the moment, though at a future date she
happened inadvertently to mention Peter&rsquo;s.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said Father O&rsquo;Sullivan as she
ended, and his eyes were twinkling, &ldquo;is it just a
little small story like that you&rsquo;d have me be repeating
at Mass, for I&rsquo;m thinking it will take just
no time at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t laugh at me!&rdquo; begged Muriel.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see how difficult it is to put into
words what I want!&rdquo; She dropped her hands
in her lap and gazed at him tragically.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, but have a try,&rdquo; urged Father O&rsquo;Sullivan.
&ldquo;Perhaps I can be helping you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;First, then,&rdquo; said Muriel, &ldquo;I want her to be
happy again, and I don&rsquo;t see how that can be
unless she hears from him, and even that alone
would be no good, because I&rsquo;m sure to be really
happy she&rsquo;d have to marry him, and you see he
has committed forgery. If only that could be
untrue&mdash;but it&rsquo;s impossible, and I don&rsquo;t see how
anything can come right,&rdquo; she ended despairingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Father O&rsquo;Sullivan rubbed his hair up the wrong
way. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a Mass with the intention of
things coming right you want me to say, when all
the time you&rsquo;re feeling sure they can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he remarked
severely. &ldquo;And if I&rsquo;m going to say it
that way myself, what kind of faith do you think
I&rsquo;m going to have in it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel looked at him contritely. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t
you see&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, I see fast enough,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
get at what you want the other way round. To
begin with, you want the young man never to
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>have committed the forgery, and then you want
to run through the whole gamut till they live
happily ever after. And all the time you&rsquo;re wishing
it, and wanting me to pray for it, you&rsquo;re
telling yourself it can&rsquo;t be. Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo; His
twinkling old eyes belied the half-severity of his
words.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, but,&rdquo; said Muriel, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s such a lot
to ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Father O&rsquo;Sullivan leaned forward and tapped
the forefinger of his right hand in the palm of
his left.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Faith, my child, is not asking God for bushels
and setting out a pint measure to catch them
in. It&rsquo;s a good old saying, but not my own,
more&rsquo;s the pity of it. Now, do you want me to
say this Mass for you with the intention we&rsquo;ve
arranged?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Muriel firmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll come to it, and believe that it will
be answered, whether in your way or God&rsquo;s you
leave to Him?&rdquo; he asked gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Muriel again.</p>

<p class="indent">Father O&rsquo;Sullivan nodded his head approvingly.
&ldquo;To-morrow morning at eight o&rsquo;clock I&rsquo;ll be
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>saying it then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll be praying
too.&rdquo; He leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; ventured Muriel, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather a
complicated thing to put into words.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Father O&rsquo;Sullivan smiled, a merry, twinkling
humorous old smile. &ldquo;Faith, I&rsquo;ll be getting it
into some kind of shape,&rdquo; he promised. &ldquo;And if
we could hear all the prayers sent up to heaven
I&rsquo;m thinking we&rsquo;d find many a muddled phrase
down here straightened out by the holy saints as
they carry them up to God&rsquo;s Throne. And no
matter what the muddles are, the answer&rsquo;s clear
enough when it comes.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And then the door opened and Anne, Tommy,
and General Carden walked in.</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel gave a little gasp. &ldquo;I thought you
were having tea at Prince&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">And Father O&rsquo;Sullivan, as he watched her face
with wicked pleasure, realized&mdash;and it did not
take a vast amount of sagacity to do so&mdash;that one
at least of the three was concerned with the story
she had just confided to his ears. And as it obviously
was not Tommy, and he concluded he
might rule out the white-haired military-looking
man, it left only the tall, graceful woman who
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>crossed to a chair by Muriel and began pulling
off her gloves.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We got bored,&rdquo; said Tommy; &ldquo;at least Anne
did, and we decided to come home to tea. And
we met General Carden on the doorstep, and
here we all are. And if you&rsquo;re too flustered
for some reason to introduce everybody nicely,
I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, Tommy,&rdquo; said Muriel, laughing
and recovering her equanimity. &ldquo;Ring the
bell, and we&rsquo;ll have fresh tea made.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No need,&rdquo; said Tommy. &ldquo;I saw Morris in
the hall and told him.&rdquo; And he sat down by
Father O&rsquo;Sullivan. General Carden took a chair
near Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I was sorry not to find you at home when I
called last Thursday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your servant
told me you were at home on Tuesdays.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Anne. She hesitated, half doubtful.
Then she added: &ldquo;But perhaps you&rsquo;ll come
another afternoon? At-home days are not very
satisfactory. Shall we say Wednesday?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I shall be delighted,&rdquo; returned General Carden.
&ldquo;We had, if I remember rightly, a long argument
the last time we met, about a book. Let me see,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>what was the author&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; He wrinkled his
brows, reflective, thoughtful.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne turned to put her gloves on the table
beside her. &ldquo;Robin Adair, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she asked
quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah, yes, of course!&rdquo; replied the old hypocrite.</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel glanced at Anne. &ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she reflected
with admiration, &ldquo;that I could act as well.
I nearly gave myself away just now, when they
all descended on me like an avalanche. And I&rsquo;d
bet my bottom dollar Father O&rsquo;Sullivan guessed
something.&rdquo; Which bet, if there had been any
one to take her on, Muriel would certainly have
won.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne, as she drove towards Chelsea half an
hour later, wondered vaguely why she had asked
General Carden to tea with her. Finally she
decided that it was for the obvious reason that
he wanted to come, and she would have been rude
if she had not done so.</p>

<p class="indent">And Father O&rsquo;Sullivan, as he walked home,
ruminated on the tangled story Muriel had told
him. It was only one of the many tangles in
the world, and he knew it, but it had been brought
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>directly to his notice, and he had a very simple
and perfect faith that the good God would unravel
the knots in His own way and at His own
time.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII</p>

<h3 class="no-break">DUM SPIRO, SPERO</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> know how there are times in our lives when
the days hang heavily, each moment dragging on
leaden feet, weighted all the more grievously
because we are ready to protest to our fellow-men,
to ourselves perhaps, that the days are not grey,
but each one as full of light as we would have it
be. And if you do not know you are lucky. Or
are you lucky? Are not the heavy clouds, which
temporarily hide the golden sunshine, better than
a dull monochrome of a life, in which neither cloud
nor sunshine is existent? For is it not by the
very brightness of the sun which has been, that
we recognize the clouds which now obscure it?
It is when the sun has never shone in its fullest
splendour for us that we do not recognize the
existence of the clouds, for to say that any life is
passed in one unbroken dream of golden glory is to
make a statement which one will dare to denounce
as untrue. If there be the gold of joy, so there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>will come the clouds of sorrow, and a life without
clouds is of necessity one without sun, a monochrome
of a life, peaceful perhaps, but lacking in
intensity.</p>

<p class="indent">The days passed slowly for Anne. They no
longer went by with the gay carelessness of a year,
six months, nay, only three months ago. Take
an interest out of your life, however chary you
may have been of admitting the existence of that
interest to your secret heart, and then fill your
days with gaiety, friends, books, anything and
everything but the one thing you want, and you
will find it a method of subtraction and addition
which is apt to result in a distinctly unsatisfactory
sum total.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not to be supposed, however, that Anne
wore her heart upon her sleeve for society daws
to peck at. She hid it and its little ache deep
under a charming courtliness which was, if anything,
more charming than usual. And if she
smiled a little more frequently, if a <i>bon mot</i> came
more readily to her lips, after all they were but
attempts to bury the heartache a bit deeper, and
it was at least the real Anne who once more walked
the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p class="indent">She saw Millicent occasionally, but only occasionally.
There was now between them a civil
exchange of courtesies; an assumption, but merely
an assumption, of the old friendly footing. On
a certain afternoon in the White House Millicent
had attempted to give a version of a particular
story to Anne. To which Anne had responded
that she already knew it. Millicent, however,
had attempted to explain, and in explaining had
told Anne one or two things Anne had not before
known, which things had caused those aforementioned
cracks in Millicent to gape with such
ominous wideness that Millicent herself suddenly
perceived them, and, worse still, saw that Anne
perceived them. Anne had quietly announced
that she preferred not to talk of the matter further:
the part of it that concerned Millicent was
her own affair, the part of it that concerned herself
was hers. And so it had concluded, outwardly
at all events. But it did not require a vast amount
of acumen to perceive that their former friendly
relationship was of necessity a trifle strained.</p>

<p class="indent">It is not to be inferred from this, however, that
Anne and Millicent were anywhere near warfare
with each other. Anne was far too much <i>grande</i>
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span><i>dame</i> for such a proceeding. Also her sentiments
towards Millicent were now those of pure indifference.
Millicent had never counted a great
deal in her life, she now merely counted less. Of
Millicent one cannot be so sure. She had seen
Anne&rsquo;s face on that historic afternoon; she had
seen Peter&rsquo;s face. She had therefrom drawn her
own conclusions&mdash;conclusions to which Anne&rsquo;s
subsequent refusal to discuss the matter had
given further weight.</p>

<p class="indent">Millicent would have liked to think of Peter as
pining in quiet grief for her, leading a kind of
<i>piano</i> life of minor passages in which she stood for
the keynote. She had&mdash;to be candid&mdash;pictured
Peter in her mind as a prematurely grey-haired
man, slightly bowed at the shoulders (from remorse),
gazing fervently at a photograph of a
Madonna-like woman with a child in her arms
(Millicent&rsquo;s latest by Lafayette), sorrowfully
considering the fact that the child was not his,
and announcing to Heaven that the thought of
her should guide him at last to its Gates. It must
be allowed that it was a distinct jar to find him
not at all grey-haired, not at all bowed at the
shoulders, but jaunty, debonair, carrying a ridiculous
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>hat with a peacock feather in his hand, and
talking intimately to one of her own friends, one,
too, who had kept her acquaintanceship with him
a dead secret. Millicent&rsquo;s feelings towards both
him and Anne verged on something like hatred,
though this primeval instinct was so hidden beneath
a mask of culture that no one, Anne least
of all, perceived it.</p>

<p class="indent">Of General Carden Anne now saw a good deal.
Having come once to her house he came again,
and came frequently. And every time, by some
subtle method of his own device, he contrived to
mention a certain green-covered book, and also
to speak of the author. And, queerly enough,
Anne responded. Perhaps by some feminine
intuition she guessed General Carden&rsquo;s secret,
namely, that he had a pretty shrewd inkling of
the identity of the author, and perhaps underneath
the courtly worldly demeanour of the old
man she saw the heart which longed for some word,
some sign, from him. And perhaps knowing this,
seeing this, the heart of the now liberated Anne
went out to the old General, having in a way a
common cause of unhappiness. And so the two
smiled and chatted, and skimmed the surface of
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>their sorrow, finding in so doing a curious consolation,
so queer and unaccountable is human nature.</p>

<p class="indent">And then one day, a few weeks after her conversation
with Muriel, she became conscious of a
tiny hope in her heart. She could no more say
at which precise moment it had first been born
than one can say at which precise moment the
tiny green leaves of a spring flower first push above
the brown earth. For weeks there is nothing to
be seen, and then one morning we come down to
our garden and the tiny shoot is there in the
sunshine, smiling shyly at us.</p>

<p class="indent">And so one morning, all unsuspected in its
hidden growth, a tiny green shoot of hope sprang
up in Anne&rsquo;s heart, a hope that after all her pride
had not been abased as she had feared, but that
somewhere, somehow, love was lifting it from the
earth. It is not easy to put into exact words
precisely what she hoped, but assuredly trust had
been renewed. And with an old priest praying
at an altar, and a woman kneeling to St. Joseph,
and somewhere, far away, a man&rsquo;s heart worshipping
and adoring, it is hardly surprising that it
was so.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV</p>

<h3 class="no-break">DEMOCRITUS</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now if this history be inclined to jump from
one place to another in a somewhat inconsequent
fashion, perhaps it will be forgiven, for with its
hero wandering away by himself and the rest of
the characters more or less congregated together,
it takes some mental skipping to record their
story.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet Peter was now not entirely lonely. He had
picked up a chum, a pal, in the shape of a small
and extremely mongrel puppy of a breed unknown,
but it is to be supposed that wire-haired terrier
predominated. And here is the manner of their
first meeting.</p>

<p class="indent">When Peter left the cottage in the early morning
he walked first to the market-town, where he
posted two letters&mdash;one to the Lady Anne Garland
and one to his publishers, telling them that
at present he had no settled address, but that if
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>he wished to correspond with them later he would
let them know. The consequence of this being
that when a certain blue letter, addressed to him,
arrived at their office it remained there, while
they waited with what patience they might for
word or sign from Peter. If he were a bit of a
genius, and they were inclined to consider him
so, his methods were also somewhat erratic.</p>

<p class="indent">Leaving the town, he turned his steps northward,
and for no particular reason beyond the
fact that he liked the look of the road. But perhaps
it was really a certain unseen guidance
which led his steps in that direction and made him
of benefit to a small bundle of life embodied in a
miserable little roll of dirty white hair, a stump
of a baby tail, two short ears, four lanky little
legs, a wet black nose, and a pair of really beautiful
brown eyes. Often we see these beautiful eyes
in an otherwise entirely ugly face. Perhaps it is
not surprising, for after all they are the windows
of the soul, and even a little doggy soul may be
beautiful. But to proceed.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter walked along a dusty high-road till about
noonday. It was an August day, as may be
remembered, and breathless with the quiet heat
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>of that month when it happens to be really hot.
Peter had not noticed the heat at first; external
matters were at the moment outside his consideration.
He had been tramping doggedly, mentally
weary, the sun of the last few weeks blotted out,
his horizon now veiled in grey clouds of dreariness.</p>

<p class="indent">And then at last his body began to protest.
&ldquo;If you will indulge in lovesick thoughts,&rdquo; it
cried, &ldquo;if your soul intends to give itself up to
heartache and mental torment, at all events
don&rsquo;t drag me into it. And it&rsquo;s very sure that
if you will treat me with a bit more consideration
you will be befriending your soul likewise.&rdquo; And
Peter, seeing the force of the argument, laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">It was against all philosophy except that of the
monks of old time to punish your body because
your soul was sick. Body and soul were&mdash;at all
events in his case, he argued&mdash;too closely allied.
Perhaps those old monks who had found a key
to spiritual things&mdash;a key on which Peter did not
pretend to have laid a hand&mdash;might have had such
a way of separating the two that the one did not
suffer for the infirmities of the other. But Peter
was one of us ordinary mortals to whom prayer
and such-like on an empty stomach&mdash;or an over-full
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>one for that matter&mdash;would be a thing impossible.
For his soul to be at ease his body must
be comfortable, and most assuredly he was at the
present moment increasing the discomfort of his
soul by unduly fatiguing his body. It was an
illogical proceeding, as he suddenly perceived.</p>

<p class="indent">A wood lay to the right of the road&mdash;a place of
cool shadows and small dancing spots of gold, a
silent place, still as the peace of some old cathedral.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter turned into it. He walked a little way
across the green moss, till the leafy barrier of
branches shut the high-road from his sight, and
then sat down, his back against the purple and
silver flecked trunk of a beech-tree. He unstrapped
his wallet and laid it on the ground
beside him. Then suddenly his ear caught a
sound, a faint yelping cry of pain. It was as if
some creature had for hours been imploring aid
which did not come, as if it had sunk into a despairing
silence, and then some tiny sound, some
movement, had again awakened hope sufficient
to make one last appeal.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter jumped to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Now which way was it?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;From
over there, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.&rdquo; And he set off
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>farther into the wood. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an animal in a trap,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;a beastly trap. Curse the things!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Many a time in his wanderings Peter had put
a dumb creature out of its misery. And if you
have ever heard a hare cry, and seen its soft eyes
gazing at you till you&rsquo;d vow it was an imprisoned
human soul looking through its windows, you&rsquo;d
know the fury of rage against some of mankind
that had possessed Peter more than once, and
which possessed him now. He peered right and
left among the undergrowth, his eyes and ears
alert, yet seeing nothing, hearing nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">He stopped and whistled softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Where are you, you poor little atom of life?&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p class="indent">And then, not a yard ahead of him, from a
great bramble clump, came the tiniest, most pitiful
cry, but with a little note of hope in it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Peter, and the next instant he was
on his knees, the steel jaws were pulled asunder,
and a baby mongrel of a puppy was dragging itself
feebly towards him, trying to lick his hand. &ldquo;Oh,
you poor little beggar!&rdquo; said Peter, as he wrenched
the trap from the ground and flung it into the
middle of the bramble-bush. Then he lifted the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>small bundle of rough, dirty white hair tenderly
and carried it back to the beech-tree.</p>

<p class="indent">There he sat himself down and began to examine
the wounded leg; it was terribly torn but
mercifully not broken. Peter washed the wound
with some water from his flask, and bound the
leg with some strips he tore from his handkerchief,
the small creature ecstatically licking his
hand the while.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; remonstrated Peter, &ldquo;a thing of
your size should not be wandering about alone.
It&rsquo;s not correct. You might have known you&rsquo;d
get into difficulties.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The puppy paused in its licking to look into
his face with brown speaking eyes. They might
have told Peter a good deal&mdash;a sad little story of
being hunted, hounded from place to place on
account of his ugly little body, of a last frantic,
terrified rush from a distant village, of presently
trotting along a dusty road, of a turning into a
wood which smelled pleasantly of rabbits and other
things dear to a doggy nose, and of a final excruciating
imprisonment, which had lasted through
Heaven knows how long of torment, till a big
human being in the shape of Peter had come to his
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>rescue. All this those eyes might have said. At
all events, Peter read a bit of the story.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I suppose, you poor atom,&rdquo; he said whimsically,
&ldquo;that no one wanted you, so you set out to
forage on your own account. Well, we&rsquo;re both in
the same boat. Shall we pull it together?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">It is not to be supposed that the puppy understood
the precise words, but it unquestionably
understood the tone, and it again fell to licking
Peter&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter ferreted in his wallet. He found bread
and meat, and together they shared a meal.
Water Peter poured into his palm, and the small
creature lapped greedily. Finally it curled itself
up beside him, and, despite a sore and wounded
leg, dropped into a blissful and contented slumber.
After a moment or so Peter followed its example.
He had not, it will be guessed, slept the previous
night, and he had been tramping since daybreak.
So now here were two wayfarers forgetting their
woes in slumber, though the puppy, it may be
safely averred, was confident that his woes were over.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">The sun was slanting low through the wood
when Peter awakened. He opened his eyes and
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>looked around without moving. The puppy&mdash;the
laziness of it!&mdash;had not stirred. But, then,
who knows how many hours of puppy sleepiness
it had not to make up.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ouf!&rdquo; said Peter, stretching himself hugely.</p>

<p class="indent">The puppy woke, started, cringed, felt the
wound in its leg, and yelped.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter picked it up with firm hands. &ldquo;Now
look here,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want any
more fear. You&rsquo;ve got to forget that. Do you
understand? We&rsquo;re going to be comrades, pals,
you and I; and we&rsquo;re both of us going to keep up
brave hearts and cheer each other. You&rsquo;ve got
a wound in your leg, and I&rsquo;ve got one in the region
which I suppose is called the heart. You&mdash;you
puppy thing! have the advantage over me, because
with a bit of luck yours will mend in a few
days. But anyhow, neither of us is going to
whine. You&rsquo;re going to bark cheerfully and wag
your tail, and I&rsquo;m going to write&mdash;presently, and
grin as well as I know how. The world would
be quite a decent place if people would let it be
so, and we&rsquo;re not going to add dulness to its poor
old shoulders. It&rsquo;s borne quite enough in its
time. Have you understood?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p class="indent">A small red tongue trying to reach Peter&rsquo;s face
testified to entire comprehension.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Very well, then. Now come along, and as I
presume you&rsquo;d prefer not to walk on three legs
I&rsquo;ll carry you. You&rsquo;re not much of a size, and
only skin and bone at that.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter picked up his wallet and hitched his bundle
to his back, which bundle was heavier than when
we first met him. It now contained, further, a
packet of manuscript, a writing-tablet, and&mdash;the
foolishness of the vagabond!&mdash;a dress suit. The
bundle adjusted to exactly that position which
made its weight of the least concern, he tucked
the small animal under his arm, with careful consideration
for its wounded leg, and set off to the
edge of the wood and once more down the dusty
road. With some shrewdness, at the first two
villages he passed, he hid the puppy under
his coat with a whispered injunction to lie
still, an injunction which was scrupulously
observed. Only by the tiniest quivering of
the body and the quick beat of the heart
against Peter&rsquo;s arm was the smallest sign of
movement and life betrayed. Villages, you perceive,
were anathema to him, holding terror,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>pain, and everything that was most unholy and
unpleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">They slept in a barn that night. Before he
slept Peter took out and examined his manuscript
by the light of a candle. Then his face quivered.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t. I will
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He promised it like a child who cries &ldquo;Honest
Injun!&rdquo; at the end of its speech.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What would you do,&rdquo; asked Peter, addressing
himself to the puppy, &ldquo;if you felt uncommonly
miserable and had made a promise to yourself
and a puppy to be cheerful?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The puppy looked at him, head on one side.
Then it yawned, a large wide yawn that began
and ended in something remarkably like a grin.
Finally it crept to Peter and curled down beside
him in slumber.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Grin and bear it and sleep, I suppose,&rdquo; said
Peter. &ldquo;Puppy, you&rsquo;re a philosopher, and I
think your name is Democritus.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<hr class="chap" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</p>

<h3 class="no-break">AT A FAIR</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> so these two entered into partnership&mdash;a
partnership that, on the side of Democritus, was
marked by an entire adoration, the full and overwhelming
love and trust of a dog&rsquo;s soul, and on
Peter&rsquo;s by affection and a real sense of comfort
in the small animal&rsquo;s companionship.</p>

<p class="indent">The days that passed were days of unbroken
sunshine; England was revelling, as she rarely
does, in long-continued sun and warmth. Peter
spent the mornings and a good part of the afternoon
in the shade of some coppice or in the shadow
of some old quarry or haystack, engrossed in his
writing, while Democritus at first lay curled beside
him, and later, as the ugly wound healed, set off
on rabbiting expeditions of his own, to return at
noon and share Peter&rsquo;s midday meal.</p>

<p class="indent">After having worked for some weeks under a
roof, Peter at first did not find it so easy to write
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>in the open. There were countless things to prove
of distraction&mdash;the sunlight spots that danced on
the ground beside him, the glint of a dragon-fly&rsquo;s
wing, the butterflies that flitted in the sunshine,
the bleating of sheep, the lowing of cows, the cry
of the curlew, the plaintive pipe of the plover, all
served to carry his thoughts into dreamy realms of
fancy away from the work of the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">And in these realms there were three or four
pictures that kept recurring to his mind. There
was a woman sitting in the sunshine on a terrace,
her hair warm and lustrous in the light. Peter
would see again the indescribable note of race
and breeding that predominated in her; see her
eyes grey and shining; the warm ivory of her skin;
her white hands long-fingered and slender, rose-tipped,
with almond-shaped nails; the lines of her
graceful figure; the whole fragrance, the warm
vitality of her; and hear her low, round voice.
There was a moonlight picture, elusive, full of
a rare charm. There was a picture half-hidden
in driving rain, and then a woman by his
hearth, lifting a glass of red wine to her lips. And,
lastly, a picture of a woman, looking at him,
white, silent, her eyes holding depths of contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p class="indent">And here Peter would catch his underlip with
his teeth and turn again fiercely to his writing.
It was gay writing, witty writing. His Wanderer
wore his cap and bells finely, jesting right royally,
and it would have needed a penetrating insight
to recognize the sigh beneath the smile.</p>

<p class="indent">The world, as Peter had told Democritus, has
borne much in her time. Through countless
ages she has seen the sin, the sorrow, the pain of
mankind; but she knows, if they could but realize
it, that all this is as transitory as the barren days
of winter that cover her, and that life and hope
are never dead, but only sleeping, and will awake
again with the spring. She tells us this times out
of number. Every year she silently speaks her
allegory, but it falls for the most part on unheeding
ears. In the barren winter of our lives it is
not easy to believe that spring will once more wake
for us, that however long and dreary the grey
months, somewhere and at some time the spring
will dawn. Peter was facing his winter bravely,
but he could not yet believe that one day the sun
would shine again for him, the birds sing, the
flowers bloom. For all his outward gaiety, the
present physical warmth and sunshine only served
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>to emphasize his mental winter. But Nature
knew and did her best to cheer him, and to tell
him that our interior spring and summer, though
their advent is sure, do not always accord with
hers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">One day, somewhere about the middle of September,
Peter reached a small town. He was
progressing slowly northward, but as he spent a
considerable part of his time in writing his progress
was by no means hurried.</p>

<p class="indent">In this town a fair was in full swing, and Peter
was reminded of a letter he had once received,
which talked of another fair&mdash;one in the South
of England.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a gay scene enough, and Peter, with
Democritus, at his heels, paused a while to watch
it. There were crowds of people in holiday attire;
there were endless couples&mdash;girl and swain. There
were coco-nut shies; there were merry-go-rounds
of horses and boat-cars, which revolved to some
excruciating music (so-called), set in motion by
the machinery which worked the highly coloured
wooden horses and cars. There were stalls
covered with miscellaneous articles of marvellous
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>manufacture&mdash;glass vases with undulated edges,
beginning white at the base and slowly increasing
in colour from pale pink to a violent ruby; china
mugs and cups covered with floreate designs or
flags, between two of which King George and
Queen Mary stared forth with painted pained
surprise. There were gilt clocks, boxes of sweets,
tin butter-dishes politely called silver, and all the
rest of the articles which usually adorn the stalls
at a fair.</p>

<p class="indent">A number of these articles were displayed on a
circular table covered with red twill and surrounded
by a barricade, beside which stood a man
with a number of small hoops in his hand. In a
loud voice he was urging the onlookers to try their
luck. The hoops, it appeared, were to be loaned
to them at the rate of three a penny; they were
then to be flung quoit-like over any article on the
table. Provided they fell surrounding the article
without touching it, it became the property of the
thrower. If you had ill-luck you had disbursed
your money with no result; moderate luck would
bring you a packet of sweets or a china dog or cat,
and by surprising good luck you might become
the possessor of a certain largish gilt clock or a
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>ruby vase, and all for a sum which might be the
fraction of a penny. It sounded seductive, and
the throwers of the hoops were fairly numerous,
though the acquirers of prizes were few. The
wooden hoop had an unpleasant way of falling
against the article required and propping itself
up by it as though too tired for further exertion.
But the throwers, with the hearts of born gamblers,
continued to throw and hope for better things,
till diminishing coppers or entirely empty pockets
sent them sadly away. Naturally there was an
occasional piece of luck, which fired the assembly
to fresh enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter stood still to watch, amused by the wild
vagaries of the wooden hoops. Suddenly a small
voice at his elbow spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t easy, is it? I&rsquo;ve thrown a shilling on
that there table and not got so much as a penny
packet o&rsquo; sweets. It&rsquo;s dis&rsquo;eartening!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked round. At his elbow was a small
and ugly girl, possibly the ugliest girl on which
it had ever been his fortune to set eyes. Her pale,
square face was covered with freckles, her eyes,
small and green, were like little slits, her nose&mdash;a
mere apology for that feature&mdash;was a dab in the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>middle of her face, her mouth wide and formless.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Apparently it is not easy,&rdquo; said Peter politely.
And then he removed his eyes from her face, fearing
that his astonishment at her plainness might
be perceived by her.</p>

<p class="indent">She sighed. &ldquo;I wish I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t thrown my shilling
on that there table. It&rsquo;s the third year now
as I&rsquo;ve made a fool of myself, and not a penny
left for the &rsquo;orses nor nothin&rsquo;. &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t as if I were
one o&rsquo; the girls wot folks treat. &rsquo;Oo could, with
a face like mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">There was no complaint in the remark. It was
not even a hint to Peter; it was merely the grave
statement of a fact, with the explanation of the
reason for it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked Peter solemnly, &ldquo;did you throw
your money on that table?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">She came a trifle nearer to him, and spoke in a
whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s them two things,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That there
vase&mdash;the crimson one with the white snake a-curling
round it, and the gold clock. I&rsquo;ve watched
&rsquo;em now for three years, and me &rsquo;eart&rsquo;s in me
mouth lest some one should get the &rsquo;oops over.
I can&rsquo;t get away from &rsquo;ere, nor enjoy the fair no
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>&rsquo;ow for watchin&rsquo;, so the &rsquo;orses and boats wouldn&rsquo;t
be much good even if I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t throwed that shilling
away.&rdquo; It was poured forth in a rapid undertone,
as if the mere mention of her longing might lead
a hoop to encircle either of the two coveted
treasures.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter eyed them gravely. Of course they were
unutterably hideous, that went without saying;
but there they were, representing the goal&mdash;unattainable&mdash;of
three years&rsquo; ambition.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; said Peter, and stopped. He
had once had some skill as a player of quoits.
He drew a copper from his pocket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
three of those hoops,&rdquo; he said to the man in charge
of the stall.</p>

<p class="indent">The Ugly Little Girl watched him, anxiety in
her eyes. Democritus, at his master&rsquo;s heels, was
regarding the proceedings unperturbed.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter flung one hoop; it fell on the table and
rested in its usual melancholy fashion against a
china figure. The Ugly Little Girl heaved a sigh
of relief; she felt that her confidence had been
misplaced.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter threw again. The hoop fell fairly over
the gilt clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said the owner of the stall, with an
attempt at cheerfulness. And he picked up the
hoop, handing Peter the clock.</p>

<p class="indent">Amazed, wrathful, fighting with her tears, the
Ugly Little Girl watched Peter. He threw a third
time. The ruby vase with the white snake climbing
up it was neatly encircled. The man handed
it to Peter in a melancholy fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;More &rsquo;oops?&rdquo; he asked dejectedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Not at the moment,&rdquo; returned Peter jauntily,
and he moved away. The Ugly Little Girl was
no longer at his elbow.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter worked his way through the group of envious
admirers round the stall, and at a little
distance he saw her. He walked in her direction,
Democritus at his heels.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo; quoth Peter as he approached.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned round; her eyes were full of tears,
her mouth distorted in a grimace of woe.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Now, by all the gods,&rdquo; exclaimed Peter,
amazed, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter with the child?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Might &rsquo;ave known you&rsquo;d &rsquo;ave got them.
Might &rsquo;ave known the luck was all agin me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ye gods and little fishes!&rdquo; cried Peter, raising
his eyes to the sky. &ldquo;And how was I to know
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>you wanted the honour of throwing the blessed
little wooden hoops yourself? I fancied it was
the mere possession of the gorgeous articles that
you coveted.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo; she queried.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I acquired these treasures,&rdquo; returned Peter,
&ldquo;with the sole intention of presenting them to
you. If, however, I have been mistaken&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;For me!&rdquo; It had never dawned upon her
that any one would willingly part with such
treasures, once acquired.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Peter patiently, &ldquo;for you.
May I ask what else you imagined I was going
to do with them?&rdquo; He held the gilt clock and
the ruby vase towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">Her ugly face was all a-quiver with rapture.
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed, and she looked at Peter with
adoring eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Here, take them!&rdquo; laughed Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">She took them tenderly, still half-unbelieving
in her good fortune.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I never thought,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;that no
one would &rsquo;ave thrown &rsquo;oops for me. Oh, I
say!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked at her, and then some spirit took
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>possession of him. Perhaps it was one of enterprise,
perhaps it was one of mischief, perhaps it
was one of kindliness, or perhaps&mdash;and this is
more probable&mdash;it was a mixture of all three.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Shall we do the fair together?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p class="indent">It was her turn now to look at him. Incredulity,
joy, and something akin to tears struggled
for the mastery. The last are apt to come to the
surface at a kindness to one not used to it.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;d&rsquo;you mean it?&rdquo; she asked, ecstatic.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;With all the faith in the world,&rdquo; replied Peter.
&ldquo;Come along.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">They were an odd trio&mdash;the tall, lean man in
his shabby coat and trousers and the fantastic
peacock feather in his hat, the small ugly girl in
her tawdry finery, the mongrel puppy which
trotted solemnly at Peter&rsquo;s heels.</p>

<p class="indent">To the Ugly Little Girl it was a never-to-be-forgotten
afternoon. She had a man all of her
own, and one, too, who flung shillings abroad with
never so much as a hint at his reckless expenditure.
Never again was she to care for the pitying
looks cast upon her lonely self by the other girls
who walked abroad with their swains. Never
again was she lonely. Her life was to hold a
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>dream-knight, a man with sad eyes and a whimsical
smile, who had fÃªted her throughout one
glorious September day. And her dream was
infinitely more beautiful than any other girl&rsquo;s
reality, for in it her man was ever courtly, ever
considerate, laughing, gay, with odd little speeches
that somehow tugged at her heart-strings and
brought the happy tears to her eyes. There was
never a blow, never a harsh word, such as fell too
often to the lot of the others. Thrice happy
Ugly Little Girl, with her one day of innocent joy
and her dream throughout her life!</p>

<p class="indent">As for Peter, having undertaken the rÃ´le of
swain, you may be sure he played his part royally.
He whirled on wooden horses till his brain was
dizzy, while Democritus, from the safety of the
solid earth, watched his antics in dumb amazement,
marvelling at his undignified proceedings. He
bought and ate waffles made by a stout woman with
a motherly face, who blessed the two in a way that
caused the Ugly Little Girl to blush scarlet and
convulsed Peter with inward laughter; he bought
sticks of sugar-candy and huge peppermints
called &ldquo;humbugs&rdquo;; and finally he watched a
hunchbacked harlequin, in green and gold spangles,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>turn somersaults and jest for the motley herd
around him.</p>

<p class="indent">The Ugly Little Girl gazed in awestruck wonder,
laughing every now and then in a spasm of merriment.
Suddenly she looked up and saw Peter&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t it make you laugh?&rdquo; she queried.
&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it funny?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;For the crowd, perhaps,&rdquo; answered Peter.
&ldquo;But for the harlequin&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged his
shoulders, and the Ugly Little Girl somehow
understood and ceased to smile.</p>

<p class="indent">Later they saw him outside a tent; he was
jesting no longer. Morose, silent, he was gazing
on the ground. Peter said a word or two,
insignificant but friendly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the fellow, looking up; &ldquo;you can
see the man beneath the fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Many of us wear the cap and bells,&rdquo; said Peter.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to raise a laugh than be an object of
pity to a non-understanding multitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You, too!&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Another in the
world with a laugh on his lips and an ache at his
heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Sighing won&rsquo;t ease the ache,&rdquo; said Peter;
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>&ldquo;and a laugh is often more dignified than a groan.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;And
a laughing fool is better than a moping wise
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well said!&rdquo; quoth Peter. And then there
was a call from within the tent, and the harlequin
vanished with a nod.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said the Ugly Little Girl
slowly. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t nice to be laughed at because
you &rsquo;ave an ugly body, but it&rsquo;s better to let folk
laugh at you and laugh with them than go around
with a long face. It&rsquo;s comfortin&rsquo; to think that
God don&rsquo;t take no account of your body. They
say as &rsquo;ow &rsquo;E made it, but I&rsquo;m thinking as it&rsquo;s
your father and mother &rsquo;as a good &rsquo;and in it, and
it ain&rsquo;t fair to lay all the blame on God.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Peter airily but vaguely, and
completely at a loss for a suitable reply. And
then he bethought him of the coco-nut shies,
and led the way in that direction.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you givin&rsquo; me a time!&rdquo; said the Ugly
Little Girl gleefully.</p>

<p class="indent">Much later, in the gathering dusk, there was
dancing; and, as is the way with fairs, a certain
roughness and rowdyism began to prevail. Peter
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>had his own ideas as to the propriety of certain
places for women, of whatever class.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is time you left,&rdquo; he remarked coolly.</p>

<p class="indent">She glanced up, surprised.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Peter authoritatively, &ldquo;too rough
here now for a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">She blushed with pleasure. The other swains
would keep their girls there till Heaven knows
what o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo; demanded Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;In Watermill Street,&rdquo; she replied, meek, delighted.
And then, with a sudden burst of honesty,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m only a maid-of-all-work.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Jack-of-all-trades,&rdquo; smiled Peter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give
myself the pleasure of escorting you to your door.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">They walked through the deserted streets.
Every man abroad was at the fair. Democritus
followed. It had been a day of perplexity to him.</p>

<p class="indent">The Ugly Little Girl was fumbling with one
hand at her neck; in the other arm she held the
precious clock and vase.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;What,&rdquo; asked Peter politely, &ldquo;is the trouble?
Can I assist you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;old them a minute, will you?&rdquo; She
thrust the clock and vase towards him. Peter
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>took them. She fumbled now with both hands,
and in a moment brought them away, holding in
them a small medal, one of the Immaculate Conception.
It was attached to a thick boot-lace.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter gazed at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; else worth &rsquo;avin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said
hurriedly. &ldquo;Father Mordaunt &rsquo;e blessed it for
me. I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d like you to take it.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter looked from the medal and boot-lace to
the ugly, imploring face.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, but&mdash;&rdquo; he said, and he hesitated. It
was obviously a great possession.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Father Mordaunt &rsquo;e&rsquo;d never mind,&rdquo; she said
earnestly; &ldquo;and&mdash;and Our Lady&rsquo;ll understand,
seein&rsquo; as &rsquo;ow it&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;ve got to give
you, and you&rsquo;ve made me so &rsquo;appy.&rdquo; She still
tendered it, wistful, anxious.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter took it, and dropped it, boot-lace and all,
into his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said quietly, with no trace
of whimsical nonsense now in his tone.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she took the clock and vase again from him,
and they turned into Watermill Street. At a
door she paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to try and say thank you,&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>whispered, &ldquo;because I can&rsquo;t. I know you&rsquo;re a
real gentleman&mdash;not only by your speech, but
by the way you&rsquo;ve treated me so considerate and
good. I&rsquo;ll pray to Our Lady for you as long as
ever I live, and ask &rsquo;Er to give you whatever you
wants most. And I&rsquo;ll begin this very night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; smiled Peter, &ldquo;you queer, dear little
girl!&rdquo; But though he smiled his eyes were a
trifle misty. It had been, after all, a mere freak
of fancy on his part to play the squire of dames
to a small maid-of-all-work that afternoon. He
felt himself to be a bit of a fraud, undeserving of
this wealth of gratitude. He crushed the small
work-worn fingers hard in his.</p>

<p class="indent">And so the two parted. It had been a trifling
incident; but, after all, it is rather pleasant to
think of, as somehow characteristic of Peter.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI</p>

<h3 class="no-break">ON THE CLOUD</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was about the third week in January that
Peter reached a certain town named Congleton,
and leaving it behind him, walked towards a
mountain named the Cloud.</p>

<p class="indent">The weather was now inclement; cold winds
blew, driving showers of sleet and rain assailed
him, making the progress of the vagabond Peter
far from pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">Bundle on back, his hands deep in the pockets
of a rough frieze overcoat he had purchased
some three months previously, he tramped along
the road, Democritus at his heels. It might
well be wondered why Peter did not seek some
lodging during these inclement months, and in
answer there is nothing to say beyond the fact
that a certain odd strain in him led him to continue
his present mode of living. He preferred
inclemency of weather, entire isolation, to life
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>under a roof, with the chance of meeting his
fellow-men. Perhaps it was strange, but after
all had he not already spent more than two years
on the roads, so may not the love of the open
have taken possession of him? At all events it
is not what he might have done, but what he
actually did, with which this history has to deal.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhere up on the top of the Cloud, with
its back to a small wood of pines and with a strip
of moorland and then the road in front of it,
stands a small deserted hut. It is no more than a
hovel of one tiny room, and perhaps at one time
it was used as a shepherd&rsquo;s shelter.</p>

<p class="indent">It was drawing on to the wintry dusk when
Peter saw it in the gloom, lying to the left of him
from the road. He crossed the strip of moorland
and went towards it. He found it, as he had
fancied he might, entirely empty. There was a
hole in the roof through which the rain was driving
and the broken door rattled on its hinges. It was
very different from a cottage he had discovered
some months previously, but it was at all events
some kind of shelter, and the cold without was
bitter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take possession,&rdquo; said Peter to Democritus.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>&ldquo;It cannot be styled a princely habitation&mdash;in
fact, it&rsquo;s uncommonly wretched. But
I fancy it will be more desirable than the road
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He unfastened his bundle and set it on the
earth floor. Outside the wind howled in fury;
mist, rain, and gathering dusk blotted out the
landscape beyond the road.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; said Peter with a shudder, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
remarkably unpleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He unpacked his bundle. There was half a
loaf of bread, a tin of sardines, a bottle of water,
a small flask of whisky, and a bone with some meat
on it for Democritus.</p>

<p class="indent">They finished their meal together, and then
Peter still sat with his back to the wall, as far
away from the broken door as possible, watching
the rain that fell through the hole in the roof.
For nearly the first time since he had begun his
wanderings he was physically wretched. Fate
had for a short time lifted his mental loneliness
from him, only to plunge him deeper into it.
Mental loneliness, however, he had done his best
to accept with what philosophy he might, but now
physical loneliness, entire discomfort, and bodily
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>depression were weighing hard upon him. He felt
he had lost the grit to fight further. A quixotic
action of long ago suddenly presented itself to him
as an entirely idiotic proceeding on his part. Why
on earth had he ruined his own life, cut himself
off from communion with his fellow-men, for a
mere romantic notion?</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beaten,&rdquo; said Peter to himself, &ldquo;done!
I fancied I was doing a fine thing. I thought
myself, no doubt, a bit of a hero; and now I&rsquo;m a
coward, a turncoat, who&rsquo;d give a very great deal
to undo the past.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">He was wretched, entirely wretched, and even
the soft warm tongue of Democritus against his
hand was of no smallest comfort to him.</p>

<p class="indent">He looked at the bundle on the ground beside
him. It contained his manuscript, fair, complete
but for the title and signature and the dedication
should he choose to give it one. It brought him
no atom of pleasure; it appeared to him worthless,
a thing of false sentiment, talking of high courage,
of nobility of thought, which in reality vanished
like a pricked air-bubble the moment the finger
of fact was laid upon it.</p>

<p class="indent">How in the name of fortune had he kept his
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>spirits buoyed up all these years? And why
in Heaven&rsquo;s name had the buoyancy suddenly
deserted him? Peter turned about in his mind
for a solution of the problem. Presently he
found it. It came with something like a shock.
He was older, that was the reason. Close on six
years had rolled over his head since the day he
had surrendered all for an extravagant notion.
It is the young, Peter reflected sagely, who take
their all and throw it with both hands on the
altar of sacrifice. They do not realize&mdash;how
should they in their youthful optimism?&mdash;what
they are giving up. They have never known
monotony, the grey years that roll by with
nothing in heaven or earth to break their dulness.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Something will happen to make up to us,&rdquo;
they cry. But&mdash;so Peter reflected from the
wisdom of his present vast age (he was two-and-thirty
be it stated)&mdash;nothing does happen. We
burn our all heroically, and then are surprised
to find that there is no life in the grey ashes left
to us. His optimism had gone, vanished, and
nothing but a deep pessimism remained to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Democritus,&rdquo; he said, as with
tongue and wagging tail the small creature tried
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>to cheer this terrible mood that had fallen upon
his master, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use. I&rsquo;ve made a mull of
things, and perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well to know when
I am beaten. And yet if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Unpleasant little word, which so often prefaces
all the joys that might have been and are not.</p>

<p class="indent">Bear with Peter in his present mood. The
marvel is it had never fallen upon him before,
and that it had not must be accounted for by
the fact that youth, health, and what had
appeared as indomitable good spirits were all in
his favour.</p>

<p class="indent">It is useless, however, to dwell on his misery.
Picture him, if you will, as wretched as man well
could be. He was, after all, only human, and up
till now he had fought his fight bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">He slept little throughout the night. About
midnight the wind dropped suddenly, and by
the light of a candle he saw snowflakes falling
through the hole in the roof. He was trying to
console himself with Conard&rsquo;s life of Beethoven,
which he had purchased; but with the remembrance
of the woman who had recommended him
to read it before his mind, the consolation was not
overgreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Towards morning he fell into a fitful slumber
which lasted till dawn. Then he awakened,
roused himself, yawned and stretched. The
memory of his mood of the previous night recurred
to his mind. He felt suddenly ashamed,
though there had been none but his own soul and
Democritus to witness it. Courage, high-handed,
sprang again within him. He flung last night&rsquo;s
mood behind him, and brave-eyed faced the future.
And with what is to follow it is good to think that
he did so.</p>

<p class="indent">He got up, and went to the cottage door.</p>

<p class="indent">The earth lay snow-covered and very still. Since midnight the air had
been thick with feathery flakes falling gently, silently. Just before
dawn they had ceased, and now the world lay under the soft mantle.
White and spectre-like the trees reared their branches against the
cold grey sky. Only here and there the berries of the holly and the
rowan-tree gleamed scarlet against the snow. A little stream that
in summer made faint music as it wended its way to the right of the
hut, finally losing itself in the shadow of the pinewood, was now
frost-bound and silent. Over everything lay an intense stillness, an
unearthly <span class="pagenum2" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>purity. The ground before the hut was covered with curious
little star-like lines imprinted in the snow, the impress of the feet
of feathered wayfarers seeking for food which was not to be found.</p>

<p class="indent">And then through the silent frosty air came
clear sounds&mdash;the barking of a sheepdog, the
clarion note of a cock in an outlying farmyard,
and, very distant, the sound of a church clock
chiming the hour.</p>

<p class="indent">The eastern sky began to flush with colour.
An amber light stole upward through the grey,
turning to rose and then to deeper crimson.
The white earth pulsated, breathed, awakened.
Softly it reflected the crimson of the sky, and then
slowly, majestically, the sun, a glowing ball of
fire, came up over the horizon.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter stood gazing at the fairy magic of the
scene. It was a pure transformation after the
bleak dreariness of the previous night.</p>

<p class="indent">And then suddenly he saw a man coming
along the road&mdash;a man tall, broad-shouldered,
of a build akin to his own. A thick coat covered
him, its fur collar well pulled up to his ears; a
cloth cap was on his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; said Peter to himself, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s early
a-foot!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The man paused, looked in the direction of
the hut, then turned and tramped quickly across
the snow towards him. As he came nearer Peter
saw a pleasant freckled face, brown eyes like a
dog&rsquo;s, a firm short chin, and a small reddish
moustache.</p>

<p class="indent">Within three or four yards of him the stranger
halted and spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Is your name, by good luck, Peter Carden?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Peter, surprised, wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; murmured he of the freckles
piously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found you at last! Come along
back to the hotel with me and we&rsquo;ll talk as we go.
I&rsquo;m famishing for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII</p>

<h3 class="no-break">A MIRACLE</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> here it is necessary to record certain things
which led up to this&mdash;to Peter&mdash;most extraordinary
of meetings: things which those who do
not believe in the miracles wrought by love
and prayer might regard as almost incredible
coincidences.</p>

<p class="indent">One afternoon, it was in the week between
Christmas and the New Year, Father O&rsquo;Sullivan
was in the Westminster Hospital. He had been
with a sick man for the last half-hour or so,
cheering him on his high-road to recovery. He
had only just left him&mdash;he was, in fact, in the
corridor&mdash;when a nursing Sister, a Catholic,
came up to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a man&mdash;a gentleman&mdash;who
would like to see you; he&rsquo;s a Catholic
and dying. I asked him to let me send for a
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>priest yesterday, and again to-day, but he refused.
A few moments ago, however, I happened
to mention your name and say that you
were in the hospital. He asked me then to fetch
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Father O&rsquo;Sullivan, smoothing his
chin, as was the way with him&mdash;if he had worn
a beard he would have been stroking it; &ldquo;where is
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;In here, Father.&rdquo; And she led the way
through a ward, and into a small room that
opened out of it.</p>

<p class="indent">Father O&rsquo;Sullivan looked at the man lying on
the bed. His eyes were closed, and his face
almost deathly pale against the red coverlet
which was pulled up to his chin.</p>

<p class="indent">Father O&rsquo;Sullivan sat down by the bedside.
The man opened his eyes and looked at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, Father,&rdquo; he said, with a faint attempt
at a smile.</p>

<p class="indent">And then, in spite of the pallor, the thinness,
Father O&rsquo;Sullivan recognized him. He saw in
him a man he had known from boyhood, one who
had attended his confessional, though for about
six years he had entirely lost sight of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Hugh Ellerslie!&rdquo; exclaimed he.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You remember me?&rdquo; said Hugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; replied Father O&rsquo;Sullivan,
&ldquo;though it&rsquo;s six years or thereabouts since
I saw you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Hugh wearily. &ldquo;I want to
talk to you, Father. They tell me I&rsquo;m dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo; said the old priest compassionately,
&ldquo;and if that&rsquo;s so, isn&rsquo;t it a good thing
I&rsquo;m here to help you make your peace, to have
you tell me what it is is troubling you?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">For a moment Hugh was silent,</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a confession to make, Father,&rdquo; he said
presently. The Sister moved towards the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Hugh, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go. How long
have I got to live?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Some hours at least,&rdquo; said the Sister gently.</p>

<p class="indent">Hugh smiled. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better both hear
what I&rsquo;ve got to say. It won&rsquo;t take long, but
I can think of nothing else till I&rsquo;ve said it. Perhaps
you, Sister, will write down what is necessary.
I can sign it presently, and, at all events, there
will be two witnesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">At a sign from Father O&rsquo;Sullivan the nurse
crossed to the other side of the bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Now, my son,&rdquo; said Father O&rsquo;Sullivan quietly,
tenderly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I have let another man suffer instead of me,&rdquo;
said Hugh steadily. &ldquo;His name&mdash;please get that
down clearly, Sister&mdash;is Peter Carden.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Father O&rsquo;Sullivan did not move, but he drew
a long breath. And there are some people who
say that the age of miracles is past!</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to enter into all particulars,&rdquo;
went on Hugh; &ldquo;it would mean rather complicated
business details that really don&rsquo;t signify.
But get this down clearly. About five or six
years ago, Peter Carden was accused of forgery
and embezzlement. He was put on his trial and
pleaded guilty. He got three years in Portland
Gaol. He was innocent; he was shielding me.
Everything of which he was accused, and to which
he pleaded guilty, was done by me. Is that
clear, Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Perfectly clear, my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We were friends,&rdquo; went on Hugh, &ldquo;school
friends, college friends. Peter always hauled
me out of scrapes. He stuck to me through
thick and thin. I believe this last time it was as
much for my old mother&rsquo;s sake as mine that
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>he stood by me. She was very fond of Peter.
I said,&rdquo; a slow colour mounted in the white
face, &ldquo;that it was for her sake that I let him do
it; it wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;at least, not only that. I was a
coward. She died about a year after Peter had
been in prison. I might have come forward then.
I didn&rsquo;t; I went abroad. I came back to England
only about six months ago.&rdquo; He stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; asked Father O&rsquo;Sullivan
gravely and tenderly.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said Hugh wearily, &ldquo;at least,
with regard to that. I&rsquo;d like Peter to know that,
cur though I&rsquo;ve been to him, I&rsquo;ve always been
fond of him. Tell him, if you can, Father, that
I&rsquo;ve tried to run straight since, because of him
and what he did. I wasn&rsquo;t getting on badly, but
now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He shall be told,&rdquo; said Father O&rsquo;Sullivan.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Do you know where he is?&rdquo; asked Hugh,
&ldquo;You speak as if you knew him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him,&rdquo; replied Father O&rsquo;Sullivan,
&ldquo;and though I don&rsquo;t know where he is now,
he shall be found.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Again Hugh was silent. After a moment he
spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ve got all that down, Sister, I&rsquo;ll sign
it. You&rsquo;re sure it will be all right, Father; that
it will let every one know, and clear him entirely?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Perfectly sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The Sister put the paper by Hugh&rsquo;s hand,
and he signed a straggling, wavering signature.
He let the pen fall. Then he looked up at the
Sister.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there are other things.
Will you&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And the Sister left the room, closing the door
noiselessly behind her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="indent">It was after seven o&rsquo;clock before Father
O&rsquo;Sullivan finally left the hospital. He had
left it once to fetch the Sacraments for which
Hugh had asked. And then, when the full
peace of forgiveness and union had fallen upon
him, he had lain very still.</p>

<p class="indent">Once when Father O&rsquo;Sullivan had moved he
had spoken wistfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Must you go, Father?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Not at all, as long as you&rsquo;re caring for me
to be with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Hugh turned his face on the pillow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If it hadn&rsquo;t been you this afternoon, Father!&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The good God understood that,&rdquo; said Father
O&rsquo;Sullivan calmly, &ldquo;and just sent me along to
see Tim Donoghue, who&rsquo;s the very saint of a
fellow when he&rsquo;s sick, and would have me be
reading to him and praying for him by the hour,
and me with other jobs to be looking after.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all like that, perhaps,&rdquo; said Hugh,
smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Faith, and it&rsquo;s a good thing too,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;And to whom but your Mother should
you be going when you&rsquo;re sick, and in whose
arms but hers should you be dying?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And then there was a silence, broken occasionally
by little remarks from Hugh, who,
coward though he might have been once, and
more than once, was no coward now that he was
dying. And Father O&rsquo;Sullivan had responded
with little tender speeches, such as a mother
indeed might make to a child.</p>

<p class="indent">And now he was walking towards Muriel&rsquo;s
house in Cadogan Place, and thanking God in
his kind, big old heart for a soul which had passed
peacefully away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE FINE WAY</h3>

<p class="center">I</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And</span> so,&rdquo; said Father O&rsquo;Sullivan, blowing his
nose, &ldquo;I came right along to tell you, and ask
you what is the next step to take.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Poor chap!&rdquo; ejaculated Tommy, delivering
himself of a huge sigh. He was standing
on the hearthrug, immaculately attired in dinner
jacket, white shirt-front, and all the rest of the
paraphernalia.</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel gave a little choke. She was sitting
near him in a dress of her favourite pale green.
Father O&rsquo;Sullivan had descended on them both
as they were waiting in the drawing-room for
the announcement of dinner. It had, be it
stated, already been made, but little heed had
been paid thereto, and the butler in wrathful
terms was now ordering the soup to be taken
below again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And what are you both looking so glum
about?&rdquo; demanded Father O&rsquo;Sullivan fiercely.
&ldquo;Faith, and weren&rsquo;t you having me say Masses,
and yourself setting up candles to St. Joseph,
that that young Quixote&mdash;what&rsquo;s-his-name&mdash;might
hold up his head again? And now that
the good Lord has answered our prayers and
cleared him, and let that poor boy make a good
confession and pass peacefully away, you&rsquo;re looking
as mournful as a mute at a funeral. Was it
perhaps some other way you&rsquo;d have been having
God arrange things and not His way at all?&rdquo; He
stuffed his handkerchief back vigorously in his
pocket as he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; quoth Tommy in a slightly haughty
fashion, feeling this speech somewhat of an
aspersion on his wife&rsquo;s wet eyes, &ldquo;you will not,
I imagine, deny that it was sad?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Sad! Of course it was sad, what happened
first. But can&rsquo;t you see the fine way, the beautiful
way, God has taken away the sadness?
You&rsquo;re all for saying Paradise must be a grand
place, but directly a soul gets a bit nearer to it
you&rsquo;re for weeping and wailing and crying &lsquo;Poor
fellow!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Muriel choked back her tears. Smiling at
the old priest and the half-wrathful Tommy,
she spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re just as near crying yourself as
I am, Father,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s that
is making you so abominably rude and cross
to us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said Father O&rsquo;Sullivan, and he coughed,
putting up his hand to his mouth. And both cough
and gesture hid that his lips were trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he requested after a moment,
his voice steady and a trifle dry, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s to be
done next?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Find Mr. Carden, of course,&rdquo; announced
Muriel with airy decision, as who should say
that was a fact apparent to the most infantine
intelligence.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all very well to say &lsquo;Find him,&rsquo;&rdquo;
remarked Father O&rsquo;Sullivan dryly, &ldquo;but have
you the faintest suspicion of a notion where he
is at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Not the least,&rdquo; quoth Muriel cheerfully;
&ldquo;that is exactly what we have to discover.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And how will you be doing that may I ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel leant forward, finger-tips pressed together,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>speaking with the decision of one who has
thoroughly weighed the whole problem.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;First we must tell General Carden, and see
if he knows where he is. I don&rsquo;t think he does,
but we must find out for certain. Then there
are his publishers&mdash;oh, yes,&rdquo; in answer to Tommy&rsquo;s
elevated eyebrows&mdash;&ldquo;he has written a book, a
very good book indeed, and thereby hangs more
of a tale than is enclosed within <i>its</i> covers. Failing
both those plans,&rdquo; she concluded firmly, &ldquo;Tommy
must find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said Father O&rsquo;Sullivan admiringly,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a fine thing to be a husband!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And then a second time the drawing-room
door opened, and a second time a voice announced,
this time in accents of deep reproach, that dinner
was on the table.</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel looked at both the men. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t he tell us that before? I feel
apologetic. He&rsquo;s such a treasure, and so is the
cook&mdash;both artists in their way, and we&rsquo;re spoiling
their artistic efforts. Come, both of you. We&rsquo;ll
talk more at dinner.&rdquo; A whirl of chiffons and
daintiness, she led the way downstairs.</p>

<p class="indent">In the intervals of the servant&rsquo;s absence from
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>the room, she promulgated plans, like any old
veteran at the beginning of a campaign. If they
sounded somewhat fantastic plans it is certain
that neither man had any better to offer. And
what, in her opinion, was more feasible, more
practicable, than that Tommy should take the
car to Abbotsleigh, where Peter was last seen by
Anne, and from there scour the country for a
man with a peacock feather in his hat? It was,
she assured them both, the simplest of proceedings.</p>

<p class="indent">By the end of dinner they had warmed to her
ideas, confessing at least that no better solution
of the difficulty presented itself to them. Further,
she told them, and on this point she was firm, that
they must both go that very evening and tell
General Carden the present state of affairs. For
herself, she thought Anne was expecting her.
Yes; she was convinced Anne was expecting her,
but she would telephone through and make sure
while they were finishing their cigars. Thus she
departed from the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Anne&rsquo;s voice at the other end of the telephone
presently answered her. Yes, she would be at
home that evening, and delighted to see Muriel.
But what was the matter of importance of which
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>Muriel had to speak? Too long to communicate
at the moment? Oh, well, Anne must possess
her soul in patience till Muriel arrived.</p>

<p class="indent">And then Muriel hung up the receiver, and
rang for the footman, on whose appearance she
ordered him to tell her maid to bring a cloak
immediately, and stated also that she would
require a taxi in ten minutes. Then, as one
who has put great things in train, she sank back
in a chair with a sigh of relief and content.</p>

<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden was in his smoking-room when
the opening of the door by Goring heralded the
entrance of Tommy Lancing and a stout, elderly
priest.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhat perplexed, General Carden put down
the book he had been reading, and rose from his
chair to greet them. True, Tommy occasionally
favoured him with his presence at this hour, but
why should he drag along with him a man whom he
had only once met, and that man, moreover, a
priest? He appeared, too, somewhat embarrassed.
It was the elder man who was at his ease.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We came to see you, General,&rdquo; said Tommy,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>shaking hands and introducing Father O&rsquo;Sullivan,
&ldquo;because we thought&mdash;that is, Muriel&mdash;well,
something unusual has happened.&rdquo; Neither
speech nor introduction was made after Tommy&rsquo;s
customary suave fashion.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said General Carden, eyeing them both
keenly, while his heart gave a little anxious
throb. Unusual news can easily portend bad
news. Also Tommy&rsquo;s manner was a trifle disconcerting.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Tommy, &ldquo;about your son.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said General Carden again, this time
with a quick intake of his breath. He put his
hand up to the mantelpiece. The floor seemed
not quite so solid as he would desire it to be.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He,&rdquo; blurted out Tommy quickly, &ldquo;was&mdash;was
not guilty. Father O&rsquo;Sullivan will tell
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus in the simplest, most commonplace of
language can momentous announcements be made.
It would seem as though there should be a grander
language, a finer flow of words, for these statements
and yet in such bald fashion are they invariably
announced.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no question now but that the room
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>was certainly revolving. Presently it steadied
itself, and General Carden knew that he was
sitting by the fire, the two men opposite to him,
and that the old priest was talking. Gradually
his mind adjusted itself to facts: he heard and
understood the words that were being spoken.
When they stopped there was a silence. There is
so astonishingly little to be said at such times,
though the tittle-tattle of small events will supply
us with endless talk.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Thank you for coming to tell me,&rdquo; said
General Carden gravely, and he pushed a box
of cigars towards the two men. Again silence.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently Tommy began to talk, quietly,
easily, now. He put forward Muriel&rsquo;s suggestions,
her advice, her plans. He explained minutely
the scheme she had proposed.</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden listened intent.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is like her kind-heartedness to suggest
it,&rdquo; he said, as Tommy paused, &ldquo;and yours to
follow it up. I have no notion where he is, nor&mdash;nor
have his publishers. I happened to ask them
the other day.&rdquo; He made the statement with
an airy carelessness of manner.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Tommy with a firmness which
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>Muriel would distinctly have approved, &ldquo;I start
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus definitely was the decision given.</p>

<p class="indent">The two stayed a while longer, Tommy supplying
most of the remarks made&mdash;conversation it
can not be termed.</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden kept falling into abstracted
silences, in which his eyes sought the fire and
his hand pulled gently at his white moustache.
Father O&rsquo;Sullivan watched him from under his
shaggy eyebrows. He was not a priest for
nothing. He knew well enough how to read the
vast unsaid between the little said, and the workings
of the reserved old mind were as clear as
daylight to him.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they rose to depart. In the hall
General Carden spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;If,&rdquo; he said, addressing himself to Father
O&rsquo;Sullivan, &ldquo;you would let me know the day
and hour of young Ellerslie&rsquo;s funeral I should
be obliged. He was a friend of my son&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And in those words the old man blotted out,
forgave, the wrong Hugh had done, as Peter
himself would have wished.</p>

<p class="indent">An hour later Goring came in with a tray on
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>which were a tumbler and a jug of hot water.</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden looked up. &ldquo;Which wine
did I drink to-night?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;The &rsquo;54 port, sir,&rdquo; replied Goring respectfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Hmm!&rdquo; General Carden beat a faint, delicate
tattoo with his fingers on the table. &ldquo;I thought
so. How much more is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;About eight bottles, sir. Seven or eight
I should say.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden coughed. &ldquo;You need not
use any more of it at present, not till&rdquo;&mdash;he
coughed again&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Peter comes home.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">The most perfectly trained of butlers might,
perhaps, be excused a slight start at such a
statement, taking into consideration, of course,
previous circumstances. Goring unquestionably
started. Then the mask was on again, impassive,
impenetrable.</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden still kept up that light tattoo.
He had a statement to make. In all fairness
to Peter it had to be made. It was, however,
peculiarly difficult to put into words.</p>

<p class="indent">He cleared his throat. &ldquo;There was,&rdquo; he said,
gazing hard at his fingers, &ldquo;a mistake. Mr.
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>Peter was shielding some one else.&rdquo; The tattoo
stopped. The words were out.</p>

<p class="indent">And then the man broke through the butler.
The mask of impassivity vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Lord, sir!&rdquo; his voice was triumphant, &ldquo;and
mightn&rsquo;t we &rsquo;ave known it, if only we &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t been
such a couple of blithering old fools.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">General Carden stared. &ldquo;Ahem! Goring&mdash;really,
Goring, I&mdash;&rdquo; He was for a moment dumbfounded,
helpless in his amazement. Then suddenly the
amazement gave way before a humorous smile,
his old eyes twinkled, and he brought his hand
down on the table with a thump. &ldquo;By God!&rdquo; he
cried; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">And Goring left the room choking with varied
emotions, but pulling down his waistcoat with
dignified pleasure the while.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX</p>

<h3 class="no-break">FOUND</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span>, now, are the present employment and emotions
of five of our characters&mdash;Tommy, with
car and chauffeur, off to Devonshire, which was
to be the starting-point of his search for a man
with a peacock feather in his hat; General Carden
watching hourly (though it was far too soon to
begin to watch) for a telegram which should
acquaint him of the success of the search; Anne
alternating between waves of pride and despair
and delicious secret joy; and Muriel spending
hours with St. Joseph, imploring the dear Saint
to hurry up with the job he had so successfully
begun.</p>

<p class="indent">The intervals between these visits she spent
mainly with Anne, rejoicing with her in her
happier moods, encouraging, chiding, sympathizing
when the waves of despair rolled high.
Muriel alone knew to the full the heart of this
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>woman friend of hers, saw the proud spirit a
captive between the hands of Love, realized what
the captivity meant to her.</p>

<p class="indent">As for our fifth character, Millicent Sheldon,
a pretty truthful rumour of Tommy&rsquo;s expedition
having reached her, her feelings were at first distinctly
mixed, though it is certain that presently
she found a method of adjusting them to her own
satisfaction. After all, it was unquestionably the
hand of Providence which had removed the somewhat
impecunious Peter from her life and given
her in exchange the solid Theobald Horatio, with
his equally solid income acquired from the patent
of the little brushes which, being fixed behind carts,
kept the London streets in a cleanly condition.
It is not to be supposed that she dwelt upon these
brushes; those articles had long ago been firmly
obliterated from her mind. It was in the solid
income alone that she saw the hand of Providence
and realized that all had undoubtedly been for the
best. Had Peter&rsquo;s innocence been apparent from
the outset, there would have been no excuse for
the letter she had penned him at the time of his
release from jail. Of a former letter, written on
the first hearing of his accusation and conviction,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>she did not care to think. If she thought of it
at all at this juncture it was to tell herself the
letter had been prompted by an impulse of pity,
the folly of which was shown her later by calm
reason. That reason had been aided by the
advent of Theobald Horatio Sheldon on her
horizon, she naturally did not care to allow. It
was, however, her inadvertent mention of this
first letter and the subsequent events to Anne
which had caused her to break a second time
in Anne&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">But why dwell on her further? Let her remain
satisfied, as she protests she is, in the possession
of her Theobald, her little Theobalda, and her
Theobald&rsquo;s solid income. Her influence on these
pages has ceased; our acquaintance with her may
well cease also.</p>

<p class="indent">Tommy&rsquo;s expedition was certainly not all joy.
The month of January is hardly one to be willingly
chosen for a motor tour through England, and the
weather was distinctly unkind.</p>

<p class="indent">To attempt to recount his adventures would
be to fill a volume with a description of bad roads,
hailstorms, punctures, and repeated disappointments.
Nevertheless he eventually got on the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>track of that peacock feather, and followed it up as
surely as a bloodhound on the scent of his prey,
though more than once he had to return on his
own trail.</p>

<p class="indent">How Tommy kept on the scent at all was a
marvel. It was by sheer perseverance, by following
up every smallest clue, by letting no possible
chance go untried. He was indefatigable, undoubting,
and his chauffeur, hearing the story
from Tommy&rsquo;s enthusiastic lips, warmed to the
work, and played his part with a zest equal only
to Tommy&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the third week of the search that they
entered Congleton, which was, as we know, to
cry &ldquo;Hot!&rdquo; as the children cry it in the game of
hunt the thimble. But Tommy did not know
it; and here, in spite of all inquiries, the clue
appeared lost, vanished.</p>

<p class="indent">The wind was blowing, a deluge half of rain,
half of sleet, descending. It being then seven
o&rsquo;clock or thereabouts, they decided after some
parley to drive to a hotel, put up for the night,
and renew the search in the morning. Some
slight disarrangement in the internal organs of
the car further decided them in the plan, though
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>the chauffeur averred that ten o&rsquo;clock the following
morning should see them again <i>en route</i>.
Slightly depressed, however, Tommy retired to
bed.</p>

<p class="indent">He was up betimes. In the night the weather
had changed, and snow some inches deep lay
upon the ground. Before daylight he was downstairs
and in the street. There he met a sleepy
milk-boy delivering milk. Tommy entered into
casual conversation with him, questioning carelessly,
unconcernedly, as his method was. And
then suddenly the clue was once more in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course the boy had seen him&mdash;a man with
a peacock feather in his hat and a dog at his heels&mdash;a
queer dog, a bit of a mongrel, so the youngster
announced. Now a dog of no kind had been in
the category, but the peacock feather was assuredly
unmistakable. Where, then, had the boy seen
him? The previous evening, it appeared, walking
towards the Cloud.</p>

<p class="indent">Tommy consulted his watch. It was now,
so he discovered, about a quarter after seven.
The car by arrangement did not make its appearance
till ten. Tommy demurred within his soul,
cogitated as to possibilities. Then with the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>thought of further clues in his mind he started
off a-foot towards the mountain. Presently the
town lay well behind him, a wide road before
him.</p>

<p class="indent">The crisp frosty air was exhilarating, the
chance of success spurred him on. He passed
a few houses. At the door of one a woman was
emptying a pail of dirty water. Tommy stopped
a moment to inquire. Luck, good fortune, was
in his favour. A man such as he had described
had passed up the road the previous evening, so the
woman confidently averred. Hope beat high in
Tommy&rsquo;s heart. Never before had he been so
close on the track. It had been always three or
four days old at the least.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the road became desolate of houses, a
smooth expanse of unbroken snow lying between
stone walls. After a while the road turned a bit
to the left, and here there was a largish house&mdash;a
farmhouse, he judged&mdash;lying among trees.
He passed it, the road still bearing to the left.
Tommy plodded on. The sun was coming up in
the east, a glowing ball of fire.</p>

<p class="indent">And then suddenly he saw a hut lying back
from the road across a bit of moorland. In the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>doorway a tall man was standing, a peacock feather
in his hat, a white mongrel dog beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">Tommy&rsquo;s heart gave a sudden exultant leap.
He turned sharply towards the hut.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX</p>

<h3 class="no-break">THE RETURN</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">How</span> on earth did you find me?&rdquo; demanded
Peter, as the two descended the Cloud together,
Democritus following in the rear.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;By the guidance of Providence,&rdquo; announced
Tommy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been the oddest search imaginable,
and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for that blessed peacock
feather I&rsquo;ll dare swear it had been fruitless. It
was a kind of landmark, the one characteristic
by which you had been noticed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Peter laughed. He was at the moment extraordinarily,
exuberantly happy. So can fate play
shuttlecock with our lives.</p>

<p class="indent">At the hut door Tommy had given him the
barest outline of the story, sufficient only to
persuade Peter that he was indeed justified in
accompanying the famished Tommy down the
mountain-side. Now he elaborated those details,
entered fully into the most miraculous history
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>of the last three weeks. And the story of Hugh&rsquo;s
confession filled Peter with a curious exultation.
He saw, as Father O&rsquo;Sullivan had seen,
the fine way, the grand way, in which the past
had been blotted out and his friend given back to
him in spirit.</p>

<p class="indent">Tommy strode down the mountain joyous of
heart, his honest freckled face fairly shining with
pleasure. His whole further programme was
already arranged&mdash;the wires to be sent, the breakfast
to be eaten, the train to be caught that was
to convey them swiftly back to town. The car
and chauffeur could follow at their leisure.</p>

<p class="indent">Here, however, Peter demurred. It was all
very well to tramp the road in this ridiculous
garb, but return to civilisation attired as a mountebank&mdash;never!
There were some things at which
Peter drew the line, and he drew one here, and
firmly. Tommy was prepared for him; he met
and overruled each and every objection. Had
Peter no other garments in that bundle he was
carrying? What! only a dress suit? Tommy
opened eyes of wonder. What on earth was the
use of a dress suit to a wayfarer? Oh, of course,
it was Peter&rsquo;s own business if he <i>liked</i> to carry one
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>around the country in a bundle on his back for the
mere pleasure of boasting to his soul that he
possessed one. No, of course he couldn&rsquo;t wear it
up to town. Tommy didn&rsquo;t propose that he
should. But he&mdash;Tommy&mdash;had another suit at
the hotel. Peter was much of his build; he&rsquo;d
take him to his room to change. During the
process he&rsquo;d dispatch telegrams. Then, Tommy
presumed, he&rsquo;d be allowed to have his breakfast,
after which the train. He was obdurate on that
point. Yes, Peter could have a bath if he liked&mdash;fifty
baths, as long as he agreed to take the train
at noon.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus planning, arranging, the hotel was reached.
Tommy escorted Peter to his room, indicated a
change of raiment and the bathroom opposite,
then, bursting with excitement, proceeded to find
the chauffeur and dispatch telegrams. Within
ten minutes&mdash;such was his celerity of action&mdash;he
was in the dining-room, had ordered a substantial
breakfast, and was waiting with what patience he
might for the appearance of Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter, in the bathroom, was luxuriating in a
sea of gloriously hot water, while Democritus
kept guard without. Occasionally a wet black
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>nose was lowered to the crack beneath the door
to sniff and wonder perplexedly at this new freak
on the part of his master.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is certain,&rdquo; remarked Peter, full length
in the bath, and addressing himself to the ceiling,
&ldquo;that if I&rsquo;d once indulged in the luxury of a good
hot soapy bath in a private bathroom after
leaving the jail, wild horses would never have
dragged me to the roads. I&rsquo;d forgotten&mdash;completely
forgotten&mdash;the joy of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">But at last, with a mental picture of the
famished Tommy before his mind, he reluctantly
proceeded to dry himself and don decent
habiliments.</p>

<p class="indent">Tommy greeted the entrance of Peter and
Democritus with fervent enthusiasm, and without
more ado they proceeded to make good headway
with the substantial, steaming breakfast which
forthwith made its appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Peter presently, pausing
in the consuming of eggs and bacon, toast, marmalade,
and coffee, &ldquo;was there ever such a
breakfast before? And have I once tendered
you my thanks for coming in pursuit of me?
The whole miraculous business, the entire blessed
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>kaboodle, seems to have upset my mental equilibrium
and clouded my manners.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Bless the man!&rdquo; cried Tommy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t I
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Some couple of hours later the two, with
Democritus, were in the train, sitting in a first-class
carriage, which Tommy had bribed the
guard to reserve to their sole use. Neither man
desired the company of strangers at the moment.
Under all their chaff and light-heartedness there
was a sense of bigness, a feeling of something
great accomplished.</p>

<p class="indent">Peter gazed through the carriage window at
the snow-covered landscape, his mind a whirl
of varied emotions. It is useless to attempt to
say which was uppermost. Kaleidoscopic they
revolved in his brain, a jumble of pleasure, relief,
half-forgotten fatigue, expectation, though now
through them all ran a thought of regret, of
sadness&mdash;the thought of Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">Is ever the perfection of joy allowed to us
mortals? It would appear not, mused Peter.
Here was everything to his hand that his soul
could desire, save the one thing after which it
really hankered; and with that to his debit, the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>balance&mdash;in spite of its appearance&mdash;was distinctly
inadequate.</p>

<p class="indent">Tommy, gazing at him furtively from behind
the morning paper, marvelled at the sudden
melancholy of the man. Cogitating in his mind
for the reason, and having heard from Muriel
of Peter&rsquo;s previous engagement, he thought to
have found it. If only, so meditated Tommy&mdash;no
lover of Millicent&mdash;he could realize the escape
he had had.</p>

<p class="indent">And so the train bore them onward, out of the
snow-covered land, past bare brown fields and
skeleton trees, past smoky towns and small
villages lying in pale sunlight, on to the suburbs
past whose platforms the train roared and rushed,
on and ever onward, till London itself was reached.</p>

<p class="ph2" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</p>

<h3 class="no-break">DEMOCRITUS ARRIVES TO STAY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">General</span> Carden in his smoking-room was
listening, waiting. Fifty times already in the
last half-hour he had looked over the curtain that
veiled the lower half of the window. Fifty times
he had looked at the clock on the mantelpiece
and compared it with his watch.</p>

<p class="indent">An orange envelope lay on the table beside
him, and with it a strip of pink paper. He knew
the words thereon verbatim; certainly they were
few in number:</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Found. Arrive Euston four o&rsquo;clock to-day.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lancing.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">On the receipt of this brief missive General
Carden&rsquo;s heart had thumped violently. He had
found voice to pass the good news on to the devoted
Goring, but it was well on half an hour before
voice and heart were under his normal control.</p>

<p class="indent">Muriel had descended on him radiant, triumphant,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>a-bubble with joy and glee, showering her
congratulations.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Come to Mrs. Cresswell&rsquo;s dance to-morrow
night,&rdquo; she implored, &ldquo;and bring him with you.
I want to shake hands with Don Quixote. I
have never before met him in the flesh.&rdquo; But
behind this desire, and stronger than it, was the
knowledge that Anne would be there, and, woman-like,
she longed for an immediate meeting of the
two.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; promised General Carden, smiling
indulgently as at a pleading child. In his heart
he longed to parade London with his son and let
the whole world be witness to his return, to their
reunion.</p>

<p class="indent">Again he glanced at the clock. Any moment
now! He tried to quell the tumult of expectation
within him.</p>

<p class="indent">Dare one penetrate a little way into the mind
of the reserved old man, guess at the tide of
memory he had at last allowed to flow back to his
heart? For years he had kept it relentlessly at
its ebb, a long barren shore between him and its
waters. He had feared to be submerged in its
flood; he had feared that, should it approach him,
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>it would come swiftly, remorselessly, drowning
him in its depths, choking the life out of him with
a deadly, icy cold. Now, and now only, he
realized the sweetness of its waters, realized that
their approach would be not to submerge but to
lift him on buoyant waves&mdash;waves warm, exuberant,
joyous. Oh, it might come now, come in all
its strength, come bearing life in its flow! No
longer a barren, desolate shore between him and
those waters. Throughout the day the wavelets
had lapped ever softly, gently nearer. Now calmly,
joyously, they lifted him on their surface.</p>

<p class="indent">There was the old house down in the country,
with the pear-tree whose branches reached the
window of that octagon-room. It should be
restored, re-inhabited. There was the river that
ran below its grounds, wherein speckled trout and
silver salmon abounded. Many were the fish
he had caught there, many the fish Peter had
caught. What was to prevent them from catching
more? Already in thought the speckled trout
lay gasping on the bank, the silver salmon were
giving play in the long reaches of water between
the meadows. There was the shooting, too&mdash;the
pheasants, the partridges, the snipe in the swampy
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>ground beyond the old mill, the wild duck where
some seven miles distant the arm of the sea ran up
to meet the river. The old days again! Memory
carried him on her tide towards the future.</p>

<p class="indent">And then into the midst of his thoughts came
a sound that brought his old heart fluttering to
his throat&mdash;the sound of the front-door bell.</p>

<p class="indent">He held on to the arms of his chair, his eyes
upon the door. It opened.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Mr. Peter!&rdquo; Goring&rsquo;s voice was on a note
of exultation.</p>

<p class="indent">And into the room came a tall, lean man, a
mongrel dog at his heels.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Hullo, father!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Well, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a grip of hands. Then the old
man was sitting again by the fire, Peter opposite
to him. There was a little silence. Democritus,
sniffing at the black, hairy hearthrug, was completely
engrossed with his own occupation. In
the silence the two men watched him.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he curled down with a thump. A quivering
sigh of satisfaction passed through his body.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is evident,&rdquo; said Peter with a little laugh,
&ldquo;that Democritus has come to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="no-break">PER ASPERA AD ASTRA</h3>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">And</span> so,&rdquo; quoth Peter, &ldquo;when the two met
again, he had a story to tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; queried Anne, toying with her fan, the
flimsy thing of mother-of-pearl and cobwebby
old lace. &ldquo;A long story?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;That,&rdquo; ventured Peter with temerity, &ldquo;depended
largely&mdash;I might say altogether&mdash;on his
listener.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">They were sitting, these two, in a wide window-seat
at the end of a passage. They had the full
length of it before them. It was a post of vantage.
With what generalship Peter had marked it out,
with what fine diplomacy he had found Lady Anne
and escorted her hither, is no doubt better imagined
than recorded. It suffices to chronicle
that here they were, in an alcove of soft draperies
and shaded lights, listening&mdash;if they chose&mdash;to the
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>strains of music, watching&mdash;if they chose&mdash;the
brilliant kaleidoscopic effect of colour through
the open door of the great ballroom.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;My story,&rdquo; continued Peter, &ldquo;is of a Wanderer,
one whom Fate in one of her freakish moods had
wedded to the roads, the highways and hedges, the
fields and woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Had he,&rdquo; queried Anne, &ldquo;nothing to solace
him in his wanderings&mdash;no thoughts, no
memories?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Peter steadily. &ldquo;Once long
ago Cupid had touched him with his wing&mdash;the
merest flick of a feather. The man&mdash;poor fool!&mdash;fancied
himself wounded, thought to bear a scar.
Later, when he looked for it, he found there was
none. It had been the most entire illusion on his
part. And so he wandered the roads, regretting
perhaps that he was scathless. But that is beside
the mark.&rdquo; He paused, glancing at the hands
which held the flimsy cobwebby fan.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;One day,&rdquo; continued Peter, &ldquo;into his lonely
wanderings came a letter, a mere scrap of bluish
paper with tracings thereon of black ink. A
flimsy fragile thing you might say, but to him it
meant&mdash;well, everything. I fancy he had never
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>realized his entire loneliness till that delicate
herald of joy appeared. And&mdash;here was the
wonder of it&mdash;it was written by a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lady Anne, the little pulses fluttering
in her throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; went on Peter, &ldquo;a gracious letter,
a charming letter, written by one who had guessed
at his loneliness of spirit, and thought to cheer
that loneliness, to heal the wound she fancied him
to bear. To him it came as a draught of water to
one in a waterless desert. It brought him help,
refreshment. He began to dream a dream of the
writer, to imagine her near him. He spent hours
in the company of his Dream Lady. He was no
longer lonely, no longer desolate. In spirit&mdash;in
fancy, if you will&mdash;she was ever with him. Oh,
he knew well enough that he could never meet her
in the flesh, that was part of the compact. But
disembodied though she was, she meant more to
him than all the material friendships in creation.&rdquo;
Again he stopped, his heart was beating fast.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; questioned Lady Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">He drew a deep breath. &ldquo;And then Fate
played a trick&mdash;a curious, almost incredible trick,
Fate threw the woman in his path. Their meeting
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>was strange, picturesque&mdash;I might almost
call it unique. At the moment reason did not
tell him the woman was the writer of the letters,
but his soul, I believe, guessed. And presently
he knew without a doubt his soul was right.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; breathed Lady Anne. &ldquo;He knew the
writer of the letters to him, but she did not know
who answered them.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;She did not,&rdquo; echoed Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a little pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she asked, her eyes still upon her
fan, &ldquo;I suppose he told her what he knew?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter in a low voice, &ldquo;he did not.
There is no excuse for him. I myself make none.
But&mdash;he feared to lose her letters. There&rsquo;s the
whole matter in a nutshell. He did not tell her,
and he continued to write.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Lady Anne. Again there was a
pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued Peter, &ldquo;it was inexcusable
of him. But Fate had his punishment
in store.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she queried.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Fate disclosed his trickery to the woman.
He read his punishment in the contempt in her
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>eyes. He deserved it, every bit of it. But it
hurt none the less.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And&mdash;and then what happened?&rdquo; she asked,
trembling.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;He went away,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;First he made
a sacrifice&mdash;a small funeral pyre on which he
burnt her letters, and I fancy his heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Did he do nothing else?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; confessed Peter. &ldquo;He wrote to
her. It was the least he could do. He prayed
her forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;And&mdash;?&rdquo; she queried.</p>

<p class="indent">Again Peter drew a deep breath. &ldquo;After
that there were months of a greater loneliness.
I fancy he tried to be brave, to be worthy of her
memory. She was, you see, his star.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Did&mdash;did he not condemn her for her harshness?&rdquo;
asked Lady Anne.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; cried Peter hotly. &ldquo;She was to him
his goddess, his divinity.&rdquo; He stopped.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Fate had another surprise
in store. She brought him from his loneliness,
set him again in the midst of his fellow-men.
But that was not all&mdash;it was the least. He
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>found&rdquo;&mdash;Peter&rsquo;s heart beat to suffocation&mdash;&ldquo;a
letter&mdash;one that should have reached him long
ago but for his own folly. From it he dared to
believe, to hope, that his Lady had condoned his
offence, had forgiven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Anne did not reply. Peter looked at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Had she forgiven?&rdquo; he pleaded.</p>

<p class="indent">For a second&mdash;the merest fraction of a second&mdash;she
raised her eyes to his.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;I&mdash;I think so,&rdquo; she said. And a tiny adorable
smile curved her mouth. &ldquo;Is that all the
story?&rdquo; she questioned in a low voice after a little
silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;No?&rdquo; she asked, surprised. &ldquo;I fancied it was
the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Peter boldly, &ldquo;only the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she asked with delicately raised eyebrows;
&ldquo;and&mdash;and is the rest of the story long?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;as long as a lifetime, and
longer. It stretches away into Eternity. It is a
story of his love for his Lady, his Queen. She is
immeasurably more to him than all in earth and
heaven. With every fibre of his being, with his
body, his soul, his spirit, he loves, worships, and
<span class="pagenum2" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>adores. It is a story that will take a lifetime in the
telling. Dare he tell it? Is she, think you, willing
to listen?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">Lady Anne again raised her eyes to his.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure,&rdquo; she queried, &ldquo;that he wants
her to listen?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Absolutely sure,&rdquo; said Peter, his blue eyes
holding hers.</p>

<p class="indent">&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; breathed Lady Anne softly, &ldquo;tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center3">&ldquo;Mrs. Ward has done much excellent work
in the past, but she has done nothing to come
within measurable distance of this remarkably
fine book&mdash;a book quite off the ordinary lines,
interesting from the first page to the last, founded
upon a psychological study of exceptionable power.
It is a very common thing in fiction to find ourselves
presented to a &lsquo;great character,&rsquo; but as a
rule we are obliged to accept the creator&rsquo;s word
for his greatness. Mrs. Ward has contrived to
make Horace Blake really and indeed great&mdash;great
in intellect, great in evil, and great, finally,
in good. He holds the reader captive just as he
is described as holding his world captive.&rdquo;</p>
